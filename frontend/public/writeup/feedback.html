        <h1>Feedback loop</h1>
        <p>
          In order to continuously improve the relevancy of results, FastSearch
          tracks all user queries and search result ratings.
          <em>Search result ratings</em> are strong signals of user preference
          and can be directly trained on to improve both cross-encoder (ranking)
          and bi-encoder (retrieval) models. <em>User queries</em> improve the
          domain coverage of the query corpus and can be used generate more
          diverse query+result candidates for data labeling.
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback UI</h3>
        <img
          src="/writeup/img/feedback-ui.jpg"

          class="borderless"
          style="border-radius: 8px"
        />
        <p>
          FastSearch was designed as a Single Page App (SPA) to increase the
          likelihood of users providing feedback by eliminating all navigation
          across multiple pages, making it easy for users to scan results and
          activate videos <em>in place</em>, and placing the feedback component
          right next to the video player.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking on an item In the result list opens an embedded YouTube
          player queued to its exact timestamp <span class="point">1</span>.
          Directly underneath the player are feedback components
          <span class="point">2</span> and links to related course materials
          <span class="point">3</span>. This reduces the chance that a user
          finds a relevant search result, views it in another page, and never
          comes back to rate it.
        </p>
        <h3>Storing Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          All user feedback is written to a MySQL database. User queries are
          stored asynchronously, via background tasks scheduled on the FastAPI
          framework event loop, in order to reduce the latency created by
          database connection and transaction.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="bq-title">Coming in FastSearch 2.0</p>
          <p>
            The resiliency of feedback storage will be improved by switching to
            an asynchronous queue such as <strong>AWS SQS</strong> or
            <strong>Kafka</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, as usage of FastSearch grows, clickstream data – including
            results-clicked-per-query, result watch time, result-query
            abandonment – will be tracked. These events will be used as weak
            signals to fill in the gaps when users don’t provide explicit
            feedback. For example, a search result with a long watch-time and
            high cross-encoder score likely indicates a relevant search result,
            especially if the user closed the page after. This can be modeled
            using clickstream events as features to improve the ranking model
            used to generate pseudo labels during training.
