        <h1>Deployment & MLOps</h1>
        <p>
          FastSearch is deployed on a serverless architecture in order to
          minimize hosting costs while enabling horizontal scaling. The frontend
          is served from an <span class="product">AWS S3</span> bucket and uses
          <span class="product">AWS CloudFront</span> as a CDN in order to cache
          static files, terminate SSL handshakes closer to the user and reverse
          proxy the backend API. The backend is hosted as a containerized
          <span class="product">AWS App Runner</span> endpoint.
        </p>

        <h3>CI/CD pipeline</h3>
        <p>
          FastSearch uses <span class="product">AWS CDK</span> as its
          infrastructure-as-code framework for declarative configuration and
          deployment. This enables FastSearch to version infrastructure
          alongside source code and leverage prebuilt best practices such as CDN
          cache invalidation on frontend deployments.
          <span class="product">Github Actions</span> are used to build the
          frontend static files and backend docker container, and also deploy
          any changes to the infrastructure when a feature branch is merged into
          main on the FastSearch GitHub repo.
        </p>

        <h3>Model Redeployment</h3>
        <p>
          FastSearch leverages
          <span class="product">Hugging Face Model Hub</span> webhooks and
          <span class="product">Github Actions</span> to rebuild and deploy the
          backend Docker image whenever the cross-encoder or bi-encoder model
          weights are updated. Whenever the bi-encoder model is updated, an
          additional batch of inference jobs in the FastSearch data pipeline is
          triggered in order to rebuild the ANN index of all lecture
          transcripts.
