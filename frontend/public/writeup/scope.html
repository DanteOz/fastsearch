        <h1>Application scope</h1>
        <p>
          <em>fast.ai</em> is one of the best resources for machine learning.
          Over the last six years they have released 238 videos spanning 291
          hours of free lectures, as well as a book, Github repos, a deep
          learning library, documentation, notebooks, and so on.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem space</h3>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the scope of machine learning has progressed exponentially
          over that timeline, so not every topic is covered in each course (for
          example, object detection was last covered in 2019). This causes
          students to often ask questions on the <em>fast.ai</em> forums about
          topics which have been covered in previous years but are not present
          in the most recent iteration of the course. Furthermore, while video
          lectures are at the core of the <em>fast.ai</em> knowledge base, at
          2-3 hours per lecture, they aren't easily searchable due to their
          length and visual modality.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Fortunately, course lectures convey information primarily via speech,
          speech can be captured in transcripts, and timestamped transcripts can
          be treated as a document corpus over which well understood information
          retrieval methods can be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thus built FastSearch, a semantic search engine and indexing
          pipeline which utilize all six years of <em>fast.ai</em>
          lectures to find exact timestamps relevant to thousands of student
          questions:
