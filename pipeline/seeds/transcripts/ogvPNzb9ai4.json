{"text": " Cool. Yeah, so hello. Welcome to Ethics for Data Science. I should start by giving the disclaimer that this is my first time teaching a course by Zoom. So maybe figuring some of it out as we go. Yeah, and I wanted to start by just acknowledging that this is a very kind of unusual and I think very stressful time for many of us, including me, that kind of with the current situation with COVID-19 that this is, I think, going to be different than the class would have been otherwise. And I realize that you may be distracted. I'm distracted in certain ways. So just to kind of put that out there. And that I do really think your kind of health and safety are the most important things. So we've got, yeah, the kind of shelter-in-place order this week, kind of very, very new situation. Do you want to note that I currently don't have any child care? So you may hear my daughter in the background. I've also had less time to put into the course than I would normally. I'm also spending more time cleaning and sanitizing things. I hope you are as well. I'm going to try, I think, doing questions through the group chat. So if you do have any questions or comments, that's the way to go. And I will try using the breakout rooms later on in class for some small group discussion. Yeah, just if you're interested, I, together with Jeremy Howard, wrote a post about COVID-19. And this was 10 days ago, so it's already, I guess, outdated. But many people have said that they found it helpful in convincing relatives who weren't taking the epidemic seriously on why they should. And so I'm going to start with some ways that the coronavirus intersects with data ethics issues as kind of a just current events kind of tying into the issues we'll be discussing in this class. So kind of go through some of these current event issues, and then I will kind of back up and give you a little bit more context about the class and then get into today's lesson. Oh, I actually, our grader is here. And so I'm happy for our grader to introduce himself. He's an alum from the MSDS program. So Paul, do you want to say hello? Yeah. Hey, everyone. This is Paul. Like Rachel said, I'm an alum. I graduated in the last cohort. I hope everyone's staying safe and staying home and doing all the best practices. I currently work at the FDA as a data science fellow. So I'm doing some work with, you know, imported foods and assessing risks and things like that. I'm really excited about about this class and to be helping out Rachel integrating creating your assignments. Rachel is super good at, you know, really, really well read and data ethics. And if you have a blog or Twitter, she's a really, really resourceful stuff. So, yeah, really excited to be here and nice to meet you guys. Great. Thank you, Paul. I just want to check, is the background noise for my daughter too much for folks? This is a noise canceling headset. OK, I see a few no's. That's reassuring. Let me know if the background noise ever gets kind of distracting. Nobody else needs to respond now. That was helpful. Thank you. And yeah, thanks again, Paul. I really, really enjoyed having Paul in class last year. And I'm glad to have him back as a grader. So here I wanted to talk about first this idea of an infodemic. So the WHO dubbed the current coronavirus and a massive infodemic on February 2nd. And an infodemic is defined as an overabundance of information, some of which is accurate and some which isn't. That makes it difficult for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. So we've kind of been really inundated with information and some of it's great, some of it's not. And we're having to filter through. And it's kind of unprecedented, kind of the scale of this. So there have been several articles on issues of misinformation and disinformation. This is one I just read today on why coronavirus misinformation is out of control. Sharing what we've heard is how we process traumatic events. But that can be harmful if we end up kind of sharing things that aren't true. Last week there was a list of coronavirus tips that went viral. Unfortunately, many of them were false. This is, I don't know if you saw it, the one about taking a sip of water every 15 minutes or making sure you could hold your breath for 10 seconds. These things do not prevent you from getting coronavirus. They don't determine that you don't have it. This was very widely shared and it was not actually from Stanford, as it said. Another article, people on Nextdoor are freaking out about coronavirus. They have been spreading falsehoods, linking the virus to homelessness, eating meat, and using tea tree oil as a sanitizer, which you cannot do. Do not use tea tree oil as a sanitizer. This is kind of in the news a lot and impacting a lot of people. Oops. Then I wanted to bring up, because this actually made me think again about one of our readings for this week on mediating consent by Renee DeResta. In the article, Renee kind of goes through this history, and Renee is one of the foremost experts on computational propaganda. She's looked at it from a lot of different angles. She was very early on kind of involved in pushing back on the anti-vaxxer movement and studying the ways that anti-vaxxer propaganda spread. She also did the analysis on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and she's now at the Stanford Internet Observatory. But she talks about kind of historically there was kind of a long stretch of time where in the US there were just three major US news networks, and it was widely agreed kind of what the facts about a situation were. And there were some good things about that, about having a shared sense of truth. Oh, hold on one moment. All right, sorry about that. So there were some great things about having this shared sense of truth kind of as a broader culture. But there were also a lot of people's voices that weren't being heard, and there were some serious oversights, and so Renee talks about, for instance, the Vietnam War, where kind of too many journalists went along with what the US government was saying and didn't share kind of a lot of the things that were going wrong and were not, as the government had said. We saw this again with the Iraq War in the early 2000s. After 9-11, the US decision to go into Iraq was not \u2013 it didn't receive the scrutiny that it should have and the kind of false claims about weapons of mass destruction. So there were downsides to kind of having this very centralized source of truth. And so then kind of with social media, we've seen this rise of a lot of other people getting to have a voice, which in some ways has been very positive, but in other ways has been very negative and has really led to this kind of fracturing of the ecosystem. And I think that \u2013 I just feel like coronavirus really illustrates this well. So let me go back. So this is a pathologist saying on Twitter, as a pathologist who follows COVID-19 issues closely from a medical perspective, I have to confess that I have learned far more from Facebook, Twitter, and WeChat than from peer-reviewed and even pre-pub medical research literature due to the time lag and international borders. I feel like Twitter has helped me stay kind of very informed about COVID-19 and to be alarmed about it in a positive way. But prior to when many of my friends and family were kind of still saying, like, no, it's just like the flu, I feel like I would not have recognized the risk as early without kind of the help of people I trust on Twitter. In particular, I definitely want to give a shout out to Zeynep Tufekci, who I think is an excellent source of information. And she wrote \u2013 she's kind of been talking about this for a while, but in particular for me kind of seeing that someone I admire as much as Zeynep said this was a real risk was really helpful. And Zeynep is a professor at the University of North Carolina and also writes for the New York Times, the Atlantic, and Scientific American. And she wrote a great article in the New York Times just earlier this week about \u2013 so kind of going along with all this is a decline in trust in our institutions, some of which is merited and some not. But kind of one example is in the United States, there have been a lot of messages to kind of tell people that we don't need to be wearing masks. Even though the evidence that wearing masks is helpful seems pretty strong, and we can also see many countries in Asia effectively using kind of widespread mask wearing as a strategy for limiting the spread of coronavirus. And so part of what's going on in the U.S. is we have a shortage of masks. And so sometimes the message is because, you know, it's \u2013 a lot of media outlets and kind of government sources have said, oh, masks won't help you as an average citizen, and also all our health care professionals really need the mask. And people can tell the contradiction there, kind of, okay, why are they helpful for health care professionals and not for ordinary people? And this is kind of just one example of declining or undermining trust in saying something that is contradictory. And it's clear, you know, if you wanted to say we need to conserve our masks for health care professionals, that would be a different message than saying, no, the masks aren't going to help you anyway. You don't actually need one. And so I thought this was kind of an illustration of this tension between I think there's some very positive things about social media and people saying that they can get helpful information from it, as well as the fact, though, that we in the U.S. I think are still not even \u2013 it's starting to move there \u2013 at a consensus of kind of how big a risk is this. You know, there are many people that have been kind of watching on Fox News saying, you know, this is not an issue of this really kind of polarization and fracturing. And let me pause here just to see if there are any questions or any comments about the reading, about media \u2013 specifically about mediating consent. And just feel free to put those into the group chat. There's a question, where can we find the PowerPoint slides? I'll probably post the video and share a link with you afterwards. Although I prefer to do it in video form so that you can kind of keep the context of the comments. Any other questions or any thoughts about the mediating consent reading? I'm going to get a sip of water or two. All right. I'll keep going. So this was an article \u2013 and this actually came out like a month and a half ago. I should note, so I taught a data ethics course for the certificate program at the Data Institute, and my material for your course has been kind of adapted from that. So in some places \u2013 you may see things I haven't updated yet because I am making some changes. Oh, wait. There's a question. What's your view on Facebook's algorithm that falsely labeled coronavirus-related views as spam? I have to say, actually, I think I did not see that specifically. I'm not surprised to hear that that's an issue. This is \u2013 I would say these are really tough problems of identifying what is disinformation and not, and what is spam and not. And so I think they're kind of not an easy answer. I do think \u2013 and even just this morning, Twitter announced that they're going to kind of stricter rules about coronavirus misinformation. But the fact that even right now, many government officials don't agree on what's true or not and receiving \u2013 kind of are receiving conflicting information, that these are challenging problems. And this doesn't \u2013 is not to let anybody off the hook, and blatant disinformation needs to be dealt with. There's also this issue that a lot of \u2013 social media is at scale, and we'll talk about this more later. But it's hard \u2013 like, I don't \u2013 an algorithm cannot effectively identify disinformation, because that's a problem that involves a lot of context. And so we'll come back to that, but I think there's not an algorithmic solution, and I think there are problems with kind of trying to do things very cheaply at scale, which is the business model for all of this. So good question, and we'll kind of return to those themes. Yeah, so this article, Control F in Building Resilient Information Networks, was actually \u2013 this is at least five or six weeks old, because I included it in the previous class. But there \u2013 and Mike Caulfield is an expert who studies digital literacy, and the \u2013 there was an aside reading profiling his work. So he shared this example with a tweet that \u2013 here it's got over 3,000 retweets and 4,000 likes, claiming \u2013 this is false, but claimed a husband and wife Chinese spy team were recently removed from a Level 4 infectious disease facility in Canada for sending pathogens to the Wuhan facility. And this is something \u2013 and then it linked to CBC, which is the Canadian broadcasting company, which is a reputable news source. And so he gives kind of what he calls like a 30-second way to check, like, hey, is this legitimate? And that is to click the link and then use Control F to search for words like spy, threat, et cetera. And he discovered that the only time threat shows up in this article is to say that there is no threat to public safety. The article did not say what the tweet was claiming it said. And he offers this as kind of a quick 30-second check because a lot of techniques that were taught historically about checking information focused on kind of like much longer analysis, but it's like if you give someone, you know, like a 30-minute method to check each tweet they see, they're not going to do it. Nobody has time for that. And so it's better to do a quick check. You're not going to catch everything. But to get in the habit of checking quickly is better than not checking at all. And if you give something kind of overly complex, he also cited a 2011 study that 90% of web users don't know about Control F for searching. And so this is something that is a very, very useful technique. So the article, so I shared an article or kind of required reading on kind of this profile of his work. And in it, Caulfield is quoted as saying, people have been trained in schools for 12 years. Here's a text. Now read it and use your critical thinking skills to figure out what you think about it. Professional fact checkers do the opposite. They get to a page and immediately get off of it. And so I think this is difficult because what we learn in school is often about kind of analyzing a text within that text, whereas really you want to go to another source and not spend too long on the particular source you're fact checking. And also to not be overly reliant on your critical thinking skills because often we're not going to have the domain expertise needed to adequately evaluate whether something is true or false. So I want to recommend he started, so he, Caulfield was studying digital literacy for decades even. But he did start another account on Infodemic, specifically about coronavirus. They have great shareable threads and often kind of deconstruct how do you evaluate something. And they go through cases where the tweet turns out to be true versus when it turns out to be false. I think this is a good resource and there's also a blog accompanying it. And then if you're interested, he has lessons.checkplease.cc that are more broadly on digital literacy and how to identify disinformation kind of as an individual. And we'll get into more, disinformation is very much a systemic problem and we'll get into that later in the lesson. But these are kind of just some tools as an individual. And he promotes the SIFT method, which is to first stop. And while that might sound simple, it's something that the design of the social media platforms does not encourage us to do. If anything, Twitter and Facebook, really Instagram, encourage us to act quickly and not to pause and just think, you know, is this something that I really want to like or reshare? So it's important even just kind of like taking that pause. Investigating the source, seeing if it's from a reliable news source. Finding better coverage. So sometimes if it's from a website you've never heard of, even if the story turns out to be true, it's probably better to share a version from a journalist outlet that you're familiar with and know produces thorough and trustworthy coverage. And then trace claims, quotes, and media to original context. And something about disinformation that we'll talk about later in this lesson is that often it's not a binary true-false, but in many cases it's about context and taking kind of a kernel of truth and then putting it into a misleading context. And so going back to the original context can help you tell if something has been altered or misrepresented in a way that you may not expect. And I'll pause for a moment. You can type questions if you have them, pick a sip of water, and then keep going. This is an example that a student in the certificate course found, this must have been five or six weeks ago when we talked about disinformation and he shared it. And at that point when Twitter shows you what's trending, one of the trending hashtags was no meat, no coronavirus. And this is from kind of false rumors that you get coronavirus from eating meat, and so if you're vegan you'll be fine. And so it's interesting that Twitter was surfacing this as a trending hashtag, so it's kind of showing it to people that otherwise wouldn't have seen it, like hey, look at this hashtag. And yet at the same time it was putting up this kind of display saying know the facts to make sure you get the best information on the novel coronavirus, you know, go to the CDC. And so this was kind of an interesting contradiction that it's both, you know, in some ways kind of countering this disinformation by trying to point you to a more reliable source, but then it was also still including it as a trending topic. So I thought that was interesting. Something else that came up kind of as students in the previous class looked at the hashtag is that, and this is true of most hashtags as well as most memes, it was being used in very different ways. And so there were kind of users in India that were using it to spread anti-Muslim content of kind of, you know, just meat is bad, it's bad that Muslims eat meat. And so you kind of had these different uses and meanings. And so I want to say that's a common thread in disinformation as well as in meme culture. And there's a lot of kind of overlap with meme culture and disinformation, which we'll talk a little bit later. And they're, I mean, they're positives about meme culture, but it can play a role. And then a study that I'll come back to that is interesting and I think relevant here. So this is a study where the researchers asked people whether an article, whether they thought it was trustworthy or not. And then they measured people's political stance and they had disinformation that would be kind of in line with what Republicans think and also contrary to what they think and same for Democrats to see kind of this role of political affinity. And they found that both sides of the political spectrum were reasonably good at identifying when something was false. However, they separately asked when, is this something you would share? Like, is this something you would like or share? And those results were basically completely orthogonal to whether something was trustworthy. And so when people are liking and sharing things on social media, they are not necessarily even thinking about is this trustworthy, but are considering kind of totally, totally different concerns. An interesting kind of experiment that they did is they sent Twitter DMs to accounts that were sharing disinformation from kind of low quality sources. And in it they just said, hey, we're doing a survey. Could you identify if this link is, you know, do you think it's trustworthy? And they did something that was not political. And just by asking that question, they found that people started sharing from more reliable sources for 24 hours afterwards, which is the only time period they looked at. And so that was really interesting. And so there the idea was kind of just by even prompting people to think about trustworthiness as something that they should be evaluating, that they saw kind of better, better results. And they note in the paper that social media platforms by design often tilt users away from considering accuracy. They encourage us to rapidly scroll and spontaneously engage. They mix very serious news content with emotionally engaging content. And so that can be hard to, you know, be reading about kind of very serious issues and news events and then have that interspersed with baby pictures and cat photos and also the immediate quantified feedback in the form of number of likes. And so all these things kind of keep us from really reflecting on accuracy. All right. So I'm going to pause. I'll come back to disinformation later. But this was just a little bit that I think is relevant on kind of how disinformation relates to the coronavirus and what we're what we're seeing in the news right now. And so then a second big area that we will cover this in week four, privacy and surveillance, is how efforts to stop the coronavirus may be used to justify increasing surveillance and some controversial impingements on privacy. So, for instance, there was a company I think earlier this week that announced that it's deploying a coronavirus detecting camera, that surveillance camera with a thermal measurement in it. And I would say it's totally unconfirmed that this is even effective. If it is, that would raise issues. Well, I mean, if it's it raises issues either way. If it's if it's doing what it says and if it's not about what that means. Google, the government partnered with Google just in this pilot program on part of it's to kind of prioritize who gets COVID-19 test. But it turns out you had to have a Google account to do it, which was controversial of kind of why is this private company that may not necessarily be is up on kind of HIPAA and our privacy protections getting this data in this and we'll talk more about these sometimes kind of opaque private public partnerships and what that means. Many, many governments have been kind of weighing different surveillance tools. Israel announced that it would be using kind of some of its anti terrorist measurements of tracking people's individual cell phone data and who they're, you know, are they properly socially distancing, who are they interacting with. Although there are kind of many, many countries around the world that are doing that with regards to coronavirus. There was the announcement that Uber had created a portal for public health authorities to share people's health data so that they could suspend drivers and riders. And again, many of these things raise issues around privacy, you know, and understanding that people with coronavirus may be facing a lot of stigma. And so we'll discuss more but just this is definitely kind of bringing some of these issues to the forefront. Alright, and so now, so that's just kind of an opening kind of how how current events relate to this course. Now I'm going to just step back and introduce myself and say more about the course. So I've been at the Data Institute part time for the last almost four years and I've taught in the MSDS program during that time. I've taught electives such as computational linear algebra and NLP. And then just last summer we launched a new center of data ethics with funding from Craig Newmark for inaugural year. And with the goal of really focusing on kind of what are the ethics issues, what are the most urgent ethics issues where real people are already being harmed by them. And in particular, really we'll be covering a lot of them in this course I see a few big areas as bias, disinformation and surveillance. And we want to want to be involved with a mix of education, research, policy. We did host a tech policy workshop in November, and that was fully recorded I've released some of the videos and we'll be releasing more in the coming coming month, hopefully. We've also, we had some great speakers lined up for the Friday seminar later this spring. We've had to had to cancel those for obvious reasons, but I hope to bring those speakers back in the future. Hopefully as alum you can you can come back and hear those talks. So that's just a little bit of background. And so I'm the founding director for the center. And so this has been a full time focus since last summer. Let me move the group chat. Okay. So, previously I have a PhD in math, I had studied math and computer science and undergrad and then I worked as a data scientist and software engineer in the tech industry. And so I realized that you've met all the other professors by now but since this is my first course for the year. I've also taught and I've taught at the you know, college and grad school level I've taught in a coding boot camps have kind of taught online so I've seen a variety of education models. And then I'm co founder of fast AI, which is a nonprofit research lab making AI more accessible, particularly to people with little data with diverse backgrounds who are outside of what is kind of seen as the stereotypical AI researcher. And we have a course practical, a free course practical deep learning for coders that's available online and also taught in person. Usually at the data Institute, although we are doing it virtually this spring. I write about issues of data ethics and that was part of how I first so several years ago kind of started spending more and more time writing about data ethics and speaking about it until it kind of took over took over my life and tweet about these comments. These topics frequently as well. So for the course, I'll be using forums dot fast dot AI for online discussion in the email. I sent out a link to a spreadsheet. So you need to create an account, which is free and I will add you to the private group to access this this forum. A few things to note one I do plan to while it's private right now. I do plan to open this up later this summer and I will send out an email before I do but wanted you to be aware of that. Secondly, I've used the same group for the certificate course. So you will see kind of People that you won't recognize from the MSDS and that was the the 40 students that took the certificate course and I checked not too long before class and it looked like 49 of you had Created it created an account. If you haven't done that yet, please do so and please add your username to the spreadsheet and I will kind of keep adding you to this group. Feel free to create new topics here, particularly if you read about something related to data ethics and are curious about what others think you can also discuss more kind of related to the the lecture or the readings. So this is where we'll be doing our online discussions. Alright, now I wanted to say a little bit just about tech ethics and what we teach when we teach teach ethics. And so Casey Feasler is someone I really admire a professor at the University of Colorado and I guess about two years ago she created a crowd source spreadsheet collecting syllabi of who is teaching Data related courses in computer science or information schools kind of technology related data science programs and she collected over 200 courses. Which is amazing. And so that's a great resource. You can find this online is kind of this spreadsheet and I love love reading other people's syllabi to find out what they're teaching. So Casey went on to do a meta analysis of the syllabi and she wrote a paper about that. What do we teach when we teach tech ethics. And first I want to say there are a lot of kind of open or debated questions just within this field of teaching teaching ethics. One is should ethics be a standalone course, which is what this is versus worked into every course, which is a lot kind of more complicated logistically to pull off, but to have a little bit of ethics and kind of every course in your program. So clearly we're doing the standalone course here. There are also kind of debates about who should be the one teaching it a computer scientist a philosopher a sociologist and if you read read her paper. She has a kind of a table of what were the home departments for all the people teaching the courses listed listed in the spreadsheet. And here it is. Move the Video. And so where was the course home and the instructor home and just look at the variety here. So there's computer science information science philosophy communication science and technology studies engineering law math business really really wide range. And then what topics to cover. This is such kind of such a broad field. So here is a list of some of the topics that can be covered. Law and policy privacy and surveillance philosophy inequality justice and human rights AI and algorithms social and environmental impact. And actually, I'm not going to read these all because it's too much AI and robots working labor cybersecurity. And so this is this is way more than you can cover in any one course, you can probably tell, but these are these are all important topics. What learning outcomes. And so this is the area where there was kind of the most agreement in particular, being able to critique. And I think that's kind of critiquing products and design decisions. Spotting issues making arguments improving communication. These all showed up kind of repeatedly and a lot of the syllabi. So this is a little bit kind of encouraging that here there is kind of some common skills being taught And then I just am going to share one quote from the paper. Our analysis reveals a great deal of variability across tech ethics courses in terms of the content taught. However, the lack of consistency of content is not surprising considering the lack of standards in the space. And the disciplinary breadth of the syllabi we covered. And this is not necessarily a bad thing. And I think she goes on to say that we can kind of Potentially learn from each other and see what as what different groups are doing. But this is a incredibly broad and interdisciplinary field. So for our course, here is a list of what we'll be covering disinformation bias and fairness. So I like to kind of start with really kind of practical case studies and then we'll go back more to kind of the foundation of ethics and kind of You know what even is the study of ethics. I do try to focus on kind of practical tools, you can use. I hope that this will be useful to you and your future workplaces. Privacy and surveillance who, how and why problems get scoped the way they do. Our current ecosystem and by that I mean the the kind of the tech ecosystem. So certain attributes of venture capital of how tech companies operate of Things like hyper growth and blitz scaling also the reliance on metrics. And so these are kind of patterns that show up across the industry that have helped kind of create some of the situations that we're in and are important to understand. And algorithmic colonialism. So when you have companies from one country kind of operating and other countries, often with not much understanding of the local culture and then kind of next steps and how how to keep going with this. I should also note to the the previous course I taught was six weeks long and this one is eight weeks long, although the the class periods are a little bit shorter for this. So I currently have week seven and eight listed as to be decided. I think that we're going to kind of run over on some of this, but I will, I will kind of keep you posted on on what I what I add Quick question before we move on from the overview. Will we only be using the fast AI forums or we also have a slack channel and I would prefer to only use the forums in that the forums have Much better search functionality. I think a problem with slack is that you can end up kind of having the same conversation again and again because it's tougher to search the forums automatically. Even when you start creating a topic will show you similar topics to make sure that your questions not already answered. And I think they kind of create something that lasts longer. Although you you all are welcome. If you let me know if you would want to slack channel just for yourself. I think I'd prefer to keep those discussion on the forums. I'll say Another question was, who are the type of people that took the intro to data ethics certificate. That's a great question. It was a really, really diverse group in terms of background, which I loved. So we had we had software engineers and data scientist in it, but we also had product managers. We had grad students from a few different fields. And different programs people and a lot of people are kind of bringing, you know, we had a few people that work in Kind of medicine or patient related fields and we're interested about health data. We had people that had worked in trust and safety. So it was people that have worked at nonprofits. So it was a very broad group, which was pretty pretty interesting. Another question is this more like a philosophy class learn more about problems rather than solution, which may not exist yet. It is. Yeah. So I, I try to offer I call them steps towards solutions in in each lesson, but many of these problems are so kind of complex and also Relatively new or at least new to be getting this kind of widespread attention that there are not good solutions yet, which can be really Really dissatisfying. I know because you know I want better solutions and I often people ask me like what they can do and I and I wanted to tell you suggestions. There are definitely things you can do, but often they are not that they are not full solutions, which I know can be discouraging. And that note. I read an interview with Julia Anglin from last year and Julia Anglin was a senior reporter at ProPublica And she helped create the the field of algorithmic fairness. So she worked on the investigation of the compass recidivism algorithm four years ago. And what she said was that kind of she thinks we're really in the early stages of diagnosing the problem. And if you look at something like the Industrial Revolution. Hold on a moment. I'll be right back. All right, sorry about that. I'm back. So I was saying Julia Anglin gave this analogy with the Industrial Revolution, where I mean we had, you know, Children working in factories for 12 hour days and kind of huge upheaval to society. And she says, you know, really took a few decades first for journalists, just to kind of get a scope of what the problem problems were and do all this diagnosis and muckraking and kind of bring and bring attention to these And then, you know, various activists and advocates could for push push for kind of what changes were needed to address address the issues that it raised. And so she said she feels like kind of we're still in like this earlier stage with a lot of the data ethics issues that have arisen where we're still even just figuring out how do we accurately diagnose and describe the problems. So we'll talk, we'll talk more about that. I do try to give some some practical steps. But yeah, there is the solutions are not are not fully there yet. So ethics is the discipline dealing with what is good and bad a set of moral principles, as I mentioned in in lesson three will come back more to kind of ethics and what are some common kind of ethical philosophies. Ethics is not the same as religion, law, social norms or feelings, although there is some overlap with all of those things. Ethics is not a fixed set of rules. That's something else that makes it hard is there's not just this like You know, here's the checklist. If you do this, you're guaranteed of being ethical, but there's a lot of ethicists talk about this idea of moral wisdom and kind of the need to over time build up your moral wisdom and evaluating evaluating problems. Ethics is a well founded are well founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do. And then it's also the ongoing study and development of one's ethical standards. And I think we'll read these later. If you did want to kind of peek ahead of just to even know kind of what are the foundations for this. There's what if what is ethics and an overview of ethics and tech practice. I'll be using a lot of resources on this topic from the Mark Kula Center at Santa Clara University and they have a great Kind of, and it's been around for quite a while. So it's an ethics center and they have a technology focus group that's put out a lot of a lot of great work. All right. So now I'm going to get into. So that was all kind of just a prelude going to get into disinformation and looking at the time. I think maybe, maybe we'll go ahead and take our seven minute break now. Since this is kind of a natural stopping point. So it's 1246 so come back here at 1212 53 and we'll continue and kind of get get into disinformation and feel free to type in any questions or comments you have in the meantime. Thanks. Okay. Hello. Welcome back everybody. So we've got some great questions during the break. So let me go through some of these So the first historic historically before the prevalence of social media engagement. How did governments handle the conflict between personal privacy and public health where people popular culture and faith favor of weighing one over the other. I mean, so one thing to note is that historically we didn't have have enough data kind of to do the types of surveillance that we can do now. So there wasn't. And I will think more about this question, but some of the things that are kind of possibilities now with surveillance and tracking information just wouldn't have even been an option before. There were I mean there were issues as you can think about in the United States. This is not about public health, but kind of about supposed public safety where the 1940 US census results were used to place Japanese Americans in Internment camps and we'll talk about that more later, but there are people and I think that was very unethical kind of this decision was made of, you know, let's use this data in a way. And actually, at the time the 1940 census was taken. It was illegal for the data to be shared in that way, but the US changed its laws during World War Two. That was a time where people were saying like, oh, this is justified because of supposed kind of safety concerns, but on the whole, I don't know that we had the same amounts of data historically. Next question. So it was mentioned that a possible a possibly better way to evaluate an article or piece of info was to get off that page and look into other references. Or mentions of that piece of info is opposed to solely using one's critical thinking. Since this is a very domain agnostic way to evaluate the credibility of information. Wouldn't this make it particularly suited for a potential algorithmic solution where the form or structure of a piece of info situated with respect to other info. Such as the citation network analysis is supposedly easier to analyze. I really don't think the technology is there yet in terms of kind of understanding what a piece of writing is saying and understanding context, which is a very difficult problem. There are many and I taught I taught NLP last summer and was really trying to stay up to date on on what's the latest. I think kind of an NLP and actually really being able to understand what's being said and context and different ways of saying the same thing and how slight variations. And a sentence can really, really change what's what the meaning is. We're still Have a long, long way to go on that. Next question is Uber's decision to suspend accounts of infected people ethical. It seems unethical from a patient's viewpoint, but ethical from a healthy person's viewpoint. And so this will cover a lot more when we cover privacy. I'm going to look at the syllabus and even potentially move privacy forward. One, well, say briefly now one question is always to ask. I think it's easy to kind of get into a particular thing, you know, is this thing that Uber said they're going to do is this ethical. I think it can be very helpful to step back and think like what are our overarching goals and are there more effective ways to get there. And so if we have a goal of we want people with coronavirus to stay home. It might be helpful to think like, you know, should we be Giving them all payments, so they're not having to go to work and that they, you know, should we get them kind of guarantees of their job protection and money like do we need to be working on a kind of Safer subsidized meal delivery, but looking at a range of options as opposed to just kind of pointing at the kind of Particular one being proposed and often there may be both more effective and safer ways of going about a particular goal. I also think it's important to think about what can go wrong. How could this data be misused kind of what does it mean to be giving personal data to private companies and that raises raises a lot of risk and we'll talk about that more with kind of the privacy and security unit. Next question. Do you believe it is possible or advisable to come up to try to come up with an algorithmic or automate automated solution for fact checking identifying disinformation. What are some caveats of one or to attempt this. Oh, there's a automating the sift method showing multiple measures of trust. Um, so I think like so with the sift method. Some of that is about design and there are a lot of design decisions that as one is like Facebook mobile doesn't make it easy to read the full URL. Or even to for people to tell kind of which links are clickable and that's something which can make it harder for people to inspect. So I definitely think there are Kind of design decisions that can really influence influence this and I think that's useful to to pursue I'm I am skeptical that could be fully automated. But yeah, I do think there are helpful things you can can do along the way. And I'll come back to this. They're also they're kind of a I will come back to this later in the lesson. Is there a nice tool out in the market to help fact check the info. When did it first published to publish that first. That's a good question. I don't, I don't know if a comprehensive one another kind of another big source of disinfo is Taking taking things out of context. And this happens a lot with photos. And so I saw a talk where they showed some pictures. Can't remember. I think they were from the California wildfires and somebody use them in a tweet and said it was like a bombing in Syria. And so there, you know, the photo was true, but it was Put in this very misleading context. And so there was a team that was looking at, you know, would it just be helpful to have the metadata on the photo of like, hey, this photo actually first appeared, you know, in California, you know, a few years ago. So there are some efforts on that and I will I will come back to this, but there are a lot of psychological factors beyond just fact checking and so that in some ways fact checking is not going to fully solve this because of All the psychological factors that go into kind of why we believe what we do. And then there's also, I want to say very, very misaligned profit incentives for the companies. And so I think the the profit incentives are a really kind of underlying issue that we will talk about more More questions. Would it be considered as misinformation. If there is no accepted ground truth. Yeah, and this is this is difficult. Difficult issue in that, as I mentioned before, a lot of misinformation is this blend of Fact and fiction and then the others, the issue of when people, people don't agree. So these are great questions. Thank you. I'm going to launch into this lesson and I think this will kind of help at least get towards answers towards some of them as well. All right. So disinformation, the threat we are facing is much bigger than just fake news. Actually, let me just close the store. Alright. So this is this is from 2016 there was a Facebook page called Heart of Texas that created Anti Islam event outside an Islamic Center in Houston. So created this event invited people to come another Facebook page set up the counter protest of people supporting freedom of religion in the US and diversity and inclusion. And so a lot of people showed up for both protests, the counter protest was was larger and journalists that covered this for the Houston Chronicle. I noticed something odd, which is that he was not able to get in touch with the organizers for either side of the protest. And so then it came out months later that both sides had been organized by Russian trolls. So this is interesting example and a lot of disinformation takes this form here you know these are real people who were at the protest. And I think would assume that most of them felt very strongly about their beliefs and so in that sense like their beliefs. You know it's not false that this is their feeling. But they're having this debate in a way that was framed kind of very dishonestly by by Russian trolls. So, and this is, this is a form that a lot of disinformation may take where it can be real people, but having debates kind of not necessarily framed in ways in ways they would have chosen. Issues of disinformation have been in the news a lot in the particularly in the last year. Deep fake videos have gotten a lot of lot of attention. I was interested on NPR last summer on the podcast First Amendment on the thread of deep fakes. And also I am very concerned about the powers of newer language models for automatically generating text, and this is on the whole gotten less attention than synthetic videos, but I think is a real risk and has been has been generated or has gotten some some attention. So today and this will this will definitely go into next week as well. I want to talk about kind of what is disinformation. How are the tech platforms making it worse. How will new advances in AI make it worse. And what should we be doing about it. This fall. So, so radio Africa was a Facebook page. In Sudan, offering offering local news, and it was revealed that this was actually set up by Russian operatives. And so this was research done by the Stanford Internet Observatory that broke camera September, October, and Russia had been working in six different African countries. And in many cases basically we're creating what looks like local news sources and they were even hiring local, local people as reporters for these sources and and the news was not just kind of things that are false or pro Russia news it also included a lot of stuff on local sports and local culture and the weather and some of the sites had the type of stuff you might see kind of with a travel agent of you know why you should visit this place. And so this was this was pretty sophisticated. And so, many of the Facebook pages, kind of try to channel people into WhatsApp groups. So this was kind of a multi platform. Multi platform effort and again it was in six different countries, and particularly the kind of hiring local people as part of it is is kind of a another step in sophistication and this is something that will become even more widespread. So there were 73 Facebook pages with close to 10 million interactions, often reporting to be local news sources and kind of encouraging people to join WhatsApp and Telegram groups which were encrypted so we don't have the information about those. So disinformation is a lot more than just quote fake news or fabricated content. It's not just news it's memes and videos and social media posts. This is an article that kind of goes back to I think early 2014 and talks about. So a group of trolls on on the anonymous web posted that they wanted to create fake accounts, such as this one for a name they can't stop kind of claiming to be to be black woman with the goal of getting the hashtag cancel Father's Day trending, which they were successful at doing. And this was kind of to They were successful in getting kind of right wing media outlets then to pick this up and kind of oh look at how kind of extreme and stupid feminist are they're trying to cancel Father's Day, even though it was kind of this coordinated coordinated attack. Several black women were kind of successful in identifying like hey these accounts look fake these aren't real people, but it was. And then this is kind of a playbook that we've increasingly seen. So this idea of kind of creating fake accounts to try to, to, you know, game, game what's trending. This also captures this is true of a lot of memes. There are things that I'm sure to some of the people doing this. This is, you know, a joke. You know, they're probably different levels of irony. There are people that are taking it very seriously, but this really kind of does have an impact on on how we see each other. So disinformation includes rumors hoaxes propaganda misleading content misleading context. Most of it is misleading not not fake. And so, and so these notes are from Claire Wardle of first draft, who has been studying disinformation for a very long time. Definitely, definitely recommend following her. And she she talks about how the term fake news has been co opted and used to attack the press and so she advises not not using the term. And then we pause and see if there are questions here. Right. So disinformation includes orchestrated camp. Oh, let me just see what this Oh, someone I was just noting that scope switch to calling things junk news, instead of instead of fake news. That's interesting. I didn't didn't know that. Disinformation includes orchestrated campaigns of manipulation. And so something to keep in mind is that I think it often we talk about things in terms of individual post you know is this particular post disinformation, but really kind of you need to think more broadly as this kind of orchestrated campaign that may involve kind of many posts and be multi platform and many, many different actors. Which is what what we saw here with this Russia, Russian operation in Africa. We also need to think of disinformation as an ecosystem. So again, it's not just some kind of single post or some single article that's false. But it is this whole ecosystem and so Kate starbird is a researcher at University of Washington, which definitely be following her. And in fact she she studies specifically disinformation during crises. So this is kind of a very, very relevant time and she I think this goes back to She studied kind of the Boston Marathon bombing. That was eight years ago, seven or eight years ago of kind of how, how to rumor star and how does disinformation spread. But something kind of she shared was this interesting. So this was looking at a group called the Syrian White Helmets and it's kind of very controversial of You know, are they helpful. Good. They're doing humanitarian work or are they kind of this colonialist Kind of practice. And she said here she's looking at Twitter, kind of who is who's retweeting different information and the pink or people that are against the the white helmets and think they're they're bad blue is kind of in favor or positive about them and showing kind of who's retweeting who and she said most of most of the people tweeting about this seem to be real real genuine people who seem to be who they say they are. However, it was interesting to look at kind of what sites they were they were tweeting from as you see youtube.com is a big one up here. And however, the box is covering Russia today, the Russian state media and as well as Sputnik News and other another Russian media org. And so it can be kind of just even seeing where where things are being tweeted from but it's kind of this whole whole ecosystem. She also talks about a kind of a common issue we have is where the the same article or same information is often posted online for many different sites. And so when people go to search something they may say like hey five different news sites covered this but it's really just the same article showing up again and again, which can also make it kind of harder to tell you know is this something that many people think or is it just coming from this kind of one source that was was echoed and she writes about kind of how disorienting it was to just even even study this. I think there was a question about you know getting at the ground truth and kind of what is what is the ground truth about the the white helmets. So Claire Wardle talks about this idea of the trumpet of amplification, which is how how information kind of can spread from platform to platform. And so many things kind of start on the anonymous web, and then they get picked up by closed groups such as WhatsApp as a reminder WhatsApp is owned by Facebook. Telegram Facebook Messenger groups from there they might spread to conspiracy conspiracy communities on Reddit or YouTube. And a reminder that YouTube is owned by Google and then get make it to more you know mainstream social media, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and then get picked up by professional media and politicians and I think I think we're increasingly more likely to even have to make all these hops and things can go kind of straight to straight to professional media or politicians picking them up. But this is something that makes it really difficult to address address disinformation because it is it is multi platform and sometimes groups are taking advantage of the different rules across different platforms. And one of the reasons I think this is important and why it's an issue is that disinformation undermines democracy. So I think we really need a shared a shared sense of truth and what what are the facts to to even be able to act and to address kind of what are the problems when we know about them, what can we do to address them. So a lot of slough bitman worked for the Soviet kind of disinformation and defected to the United States in the late 70s. And he then became a professor of disinformation and he's written that most campaigns are carefully designed mixture of facts half truths exaggerations and deliberate lies. Kate starbird wrote disinformation is not just about bots and trolls the targets cultivate shapes and ultimately leverages unwitting crowds to further spread and achieve its objectives and so often you know very sincere people can be caught up in it. In particular, something we've seen is this real proliferation of this conspiracy theory mindset and people that are kind of looking for conspiracy theories and everything that can now you know is this kind of self perpetuating machine to produce disinformation. And so this example I gave earlier of here you have kind of real sincere people, but this is still this is still an example of disinformation, since the events themselves were kind of organized in this deceptive way. Disinformation pollutes our information environment. And so it's something where then one of the maybe even the bigger concern is not just that people may believe something that's false, it's that they will stop believing what is true. And so disinformation can be exhausting and kind of get people to give up on the truth or feel like well I guess I can never, never know what is true because there's so many conflicting messages out there. So Zainab Tefekci wrote about this in Wired last year. When I talk to dissidents around the world, they rarely ask me how they can post information anonymously, but do often ask me how to authenticate the information they post. Dissidents can end up putting their lives on the line to post a picture documenting wrongdoing, only to be faced with an endless stream of deliberately misleading claims. That it was taken 10 years ago, that it's from somewhere else, that it's been doctored. And Zainab I think would, I know, supports the need for whistleblowers to be anonymous or to use kind of stable, particularly stable pseudonyms over time. However, this is really interesting and it shows kind of this asymmetry of people can take great risk to reveal a true wrongdoing and then have someone say oh that's just disinformation, which is kind of incredibly, incredibly harmful when people give up on the truth. So censorship now works by flooding with information, by causing distraction, by causing confusion, by creating doubts and just this question mark and shadows so that you really can't figure out what's going on. And to me, this is almost the opposite of whistleblowing. This is whistle drowning in confusion and distraction. And so here she's kind of talking about when you leak kind of huge, huge reams of documents where it's not clear kind of what the message is. And people can kind of read their, so this happened with Hillary Clinton's emails, where you know there wasn't a clear message of definitely like the public needs to know about if there is something kind of alarming, but this was more people can make kind of all sorts of conspiracy theories through this massive documents. And this is a real change in the nature of information. For most of history, kind of information was much more limited and it is only I think really with the web that we have moved into this stage where there is just these massive, massive amounts of information and that's changed what censorship looks like, as well as kind of what disinformation campaigns look like. She, she refers to this idea of hack and leak. We also saw this with climate gate, I don't know if you remember, longer ago where these emails were hacked from a bunch of climate researchers. Experts agree there was not anything actually controversial or wrong about what they were doing, but people kind of created this narrative of, you know, these climate researchers are so dishonest and are are doing shady things with the data. This is an example of this called narrative laundering where you take real documents. These are real emails and build kind of build a story on top of them. There have been warnings, Renee deResta has warned, we'll see probably increasingly people mixing fake documents in with large dumps of real documents. This apparently happened with there were cyber attacks on anti-doping agencies and they released kind of all this information from them and apparently some of some of that was was false. So these are really kind of large areas for concern of kind of how how the form that attacks can take. Okay, I'm just going to get a drink of water. See if there. Let me see if there any questions. Okay. So that's that's kind of some background on disinformation and what forms it takes. And then finally, one more thing about kind of modern censorship. Going back that it that it really often involves also kind of flooding all of us with information and so even though people from a wider variety of backgrounds are able to, you know, try to get information out there, particularly through social media, because there's so information so much information out there. So it's going to be harder for us to even find kind of what is important or for someone to find an audience when they when they have something noteworthy. I'm just since we're so inundated with with large quantities of information. So now I want to talk a little bit about how the tech platforms, kind of unwittingly often incentivize and promote disinformation. Their design and architecture, their recommendation systems, their business models. So it's kind of really, really baked into it. So this is not just kind of not just about bad actors posting disinformation but about kind of what's rewarded by the tech platforms and how, how do they kind of encourage us as users to behave as well. So Guillaume Tazlott is a former, has a PhD in AI and was a former engineer at Google and YouTube. And he has been very outspoken and actually included his, his reading is one of the assigned readings about how conspiracy theories can be really promoted by recommendation systems. And I'll kind of mention that about the reading first. He, you know, showed that kind of if, if you're trying to maximize watch time on a platform, telling everybody else that other platforms are lying may increase the amount of time people spend watching your platform. But it's, it's bad, kind of bad for society. And so he has been monitoring YouTube externally through his nonprofit that he founded, AlgoWatch, and he produced this graph last year of, so here the x-axis is number of channels recommending a video and y-axis is log of views. And you see this kind of extreme outlier that was being highly, highly recommended, even though it wasn't necessarily the most popular thing at all. Alright, sorry about the interruption. So YouTube, where was I? Okay, yeah, so showing this extreme outlier of being highly, highly recommended. This is Russia Today's take on the Mueller report. Even though it wasn't even necessarily something that people loved watching. And so, and this was, this was picked up by the Washington Post. This really suggests that Russia Today has perhaps gamed YouTube's recommendation system, which is not, I think not surprising. And I wrote a blog post about this, which actually I should link to David Uminsky and I then expanded into a paper that was accepted to EDSC, and I'll maybe post that on the forums. About some of the problems with metrics, and we'll cover this more in Lesson 5, but anytime you are using metrics that are super important, people will, will try to game and manipulate them. And so this is something that I think is going on kind of with all, with all recommendation systems. Let me, let me check for questions. Alright, no questions so far. That's fine. Alright, then I talked about this paper earlier. I thought this was interesting just kind of about the psychology of people when they choose to share things on social media are not necessarily even thinking about, hey, is this trustworthy. But, you know, they might be thinking like what resonates with me emotionally. What kind of what fits with my group, and there's a lot about the design of the platforms that encourages us to really scroll and spontaneously engage it does not encourage us to pause and reflect the platforms often don't encourage us to leave their platform and go to other other websites. They mix very serious news content with emotionally engaging content, and then they give this kind of immediate quantified feedback in the form of number of likes which really then can influence kind of how we behave what we post. So I think there's kind of this inherent. Everyone likes getting more likes and it's hard not to then let that start driving driving behavior. I do want to note that it's more than just the algorithm. Becca Lewis is a PhD student at Stanford and communications has written about kind of other ways that YouTube in particular may promote conspiracy theories. Just in terms of its design kind of sociological factors in kind of how people relate to YouTube celebrities and how YouTube celebrities relate to their audiences, but there's a lot about the ecosystem and that you know, no, no technology will talk more about this later. No technology is neutral and there are always kind of things about the design that will will encourage encourage certain behaviors. I thought I thought this was an interesting interesting paper. So, our online environments are really designed to be addictive and this is part of the underlying model of ad revenue of kind of the more time we spend on there, the more ads were shown is more profitable for the the platforms. The incentives focus on short term metrics and this is true with metrics in general often it is much harder to measure kind of long term impact complex long term relationships. And so those things tend to be neglected and metrics and this even see this with kind of like the focus on quarterly earnings in the corporate world that it's harder for companies to consider consider prioritize the long and long term impact of their behavior. And then the fundamental business model is around manipulating people's behavior and monopolizing their time, which I don't I don't think that all advertising is inherently bad. But just it is this kind of business model that's really really driving a lot of the decisions that are made on how to structure the platforms and what they do and we'll talk more about this on the on the note about addictive kind of the addictive nature. Zainab Tefekci uses an analogy of kind of an automated cafeteria that is learning to kind of add ever more sugar and salt and fat into foods and kind of shove them in our faces without us even asking for them. But to really, you know, and these are things that in the short term, we may want, you know, it's like, oh, someone shoving french fries at me that's super appealing. But the platforms don't always give us a good way to think about like, hey, long term. How do I feel about this is this the decision I want to be making. You know, there's something I think in the short term, it's often, you know, easier to read kind of clickbait type articles and their interest, you know, kind of peak our interest in the short term way, whereas you know reading long form journalism that in order spent months and months investigating and had to talk to many sources, you know, that's something that could have kind of a better long term impact on us, but it's a hard it's a hard decision to make in the moment, particularly when the platforms are not at all designed to support us and making those making those decisions. And I think the rest say use this slide and her her talk at Mosfest in 2018 our political conversations are happening on an infrastructure built for viral advertising. And so there's kind of this real, real misalignment there like what is what is good for for viral advertising may not be good for having nuanced political conversations. I'll check the chat again. Take a drink of water. So there's a question. Do you think platforms changing their addictive approach skewed incentives requires government intervention or societal pressure both how do you affect change. And so this is a big, big question I am I do think it will require government intervention, particularly around the profit incentives I think as long as it's kind of so profitable to be doing what they're doing they're not going to be able to to make significant changes and some of what's happening right now is I think a lot of costs are being externalized to society. And so, you know, this is something we saw and still see to some extent with kind of the environment of you know if a factory can kind of dump all its pollution in a lake and make huge profits. That's something where they have externalized their negative cost to the rest of society while they get to keep the profits. And I think that there are ways that the, the major platforms are kind of polluting our information ecosystem. They're also talk about this one. When we talk about privacy, they are kind of polluting the the sense of ambient privacy and what some of the benefits of that may be. And so I do think you need to change economic incentives and I think that government is one one effective way to do that. But these are these are hard, hard problems. All right. So humans. So now I want to talk more about yeah about people. And I'll get into this modern technology and humans evolved as social beings to have our opinions influenced by others in our group. And so, and this is hard because I think most people like to think of themselves as independent minded, but we are we are kind of motivated by who we see as our in group and in opposition to who we who we see as our out group. And this, this has an impact on on on what we believe. People, people are forming a lot of discussion, a lot of opinions online through discussions. So this is a debate on Reddit about whether the US should cut defense spending and instead spend money. Otherwise, so we've got different comments of you're wrong. The defense budget is a good example of how badly the US spends money on the military. When I'll see how but that's already happening. There's a huge increase in the military budget. I didn't mean to sound like stop paying for the military, not saying that we cannot pay the bills, but I think it makes sense to cut defense spending. So here, here's a discussion. So you can type into the chat. Does anyone want to guess which subreddit this is from Any guesses. These are all reasonable guesses I have not have not seen it yet so I see guesses for politics, military, unpopular opinions. And then I will say it. Alright, this is this is actually from the GPT to subreddit. So these comments were written by a language model, specifically, specifically GPT to and thank you everyone who guessed. I know this was kind of a trick trick question. So language models are producing more and more compelling text. These I think if you really and I kind of intentionally went quickly. If you read them very closely some of them sound a little bit off, although a lot of online comments from real people sound off. And this, I should say this is all kind of in good fun in this context because the subreddit is clearly labeled that it's that it's the GPT to language model making these posts. But this is something that I think is really concerning and raises raises a lot of potential issues. So, so GPT to and so GPT to is very controversial. We'll talk a little bit about that. I just first want to read. So this was partially released from open AI last year and then they've kind of done several kind of partial releases. This is a language model, but it was very, it was very in keeping with kind of the thread of NLP research on language models. So the techniques were kind of not outside what what other other groups were doing around language models. So one example that the team shared from open AI. So they gave gave the model the human written prompt in a shocking finding scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote previously unexplored Valley and the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorn spoke perfect English. So that part was from a human. Then the next part is all from the language model. So this is what the language model came up with. Dr. Jorge Perez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz and several companions were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small Valley with no other animals or humans. Perez noticed that the Valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow. Perez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them. They were so close they could touch their horns. While examining these bizarre creatures, the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Perez stated, you can see, for example, that they have a common language, something like a dialect or dialectic. So I think this is really compelling prose and not not everything that GPT produces is quite this compelling, but this is really compelling and kind of well well written to be to be produced by a language model. Oh, sorry, see a note that it was AI unpopular opinions. I found a subsimulator GPT2. Well, either way, let me go on with this. So I'm sure you've also heard about Or I should say, this is Katie Jones. Her LinkedIn profile listed her as a Russia and Eurasia fellow. She was connected to kind of several people at relatively mainstream Washington think tanks. And the Associated Press broke a story last summer that Katie Jones is not a real person. So this photo is actually generated by a GAN, a Generative Advertiserial Network. And so you have to think about how these technologies can be combined. So, you know, we've got kind of increasingly compelling language being produced by computers, along with increasingly compelling pictures. So these photos are all from this person does not exist.com. I really think they look like they look like real people. And online discussion will be swamped with fake manipulative agents, kind of even even more so than it than it already is. Actually, let me just pause and see if there are questions. Okay, so Alright, so, so this is this is from so in 2017 the FCC was considering repealing net neutrality and they opened up for comments to see, you know, do Americans, how did they feel about net neutrality. They got a lot of responses, millions and millions of responses that were opposed to net neutrality saying, well, yes, let's repeal it, including these listed here and I'll read you a few. Move this, I can actually see it. Individual citizens as opposed to Washington bureaucrats should be able to select whichever services they desire. People like me, as opposed to so called experts should be free to buy whatever products they choose. Citizens, rather than the FCC deserve to use whichever services we prefer. And so you might detect a pattern which is hopefully been color coded here that this is kind of a mad libs style where there are certain things that go in the initial green blank citizens, people like me, individual citizens. Something different for the kind of coral colored spot as opposed to or rather than and then there were some choices for the orange spot. And so you can see these are kind of very, very formulaic. And so this comes from data analysis done by Jeff cow. And he found that more than a million of the comments wanting to repeal net neutrality were likely faked. So these were being submitted as kind of real individual comments, but they found kind of followed this clear clear formula. I should note that Jeff cow was now a computational journalist at ProPublica. And he wrote a fantastic blog post on this, which I recommend reading. It's a great, great analysis. So first of all, after clustering comment categories and removing duplicates. He found that less than some basically three to 4% of the 22 million comments were truly unique. This does not mean that they were all fake. Many of those come from, you know, there are kind of automatic templates, you can get to email in kind of in support or against an issue. However, this kind of mail merge madlib style was definitely deceptive. It was an attempt to make things seem unique when they weren't. And there seem to be likely multiple other campaigns like this. And so even though more than 99% of the truly unique comments were in favor of net neutrality. If you looked at the overall kind of overall thing and not not taking these into account, it would seem like most of the submissions were against net neutrality. And so this was this was a great analysis. However, this was done in 2017, which may not seem that long ago in NLP years. That was a very long time ago because we've had such such big advances in NLP since then. And particularly, we did not have sophisticated language models back then. It would be far, far harder to identify this type of campaign now if someone was using a kind of, you know, one of the newest versions such as GPT-2 of language models. Actually, I'll check the check the chat again. OK. And so this is yeah this this certainly concerns me of how how this could be used to manipulate public opinion. So my co-founder Jeremy Howard said last year, I've been trying to warn people about this for a while. We have the technology to totally fill Twitter, email and the web up with reasonable sounding context appropriate pros, which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter. Kind of the stuff stuff I'm showing is very, very difficult to filter out. And in fact, I think it's always going to be an arms race around filtering it and then people developing even more more sophisticated models. And this is, you know, it can drown out real people, right, like ideally the FCC would be just receiving submissions from actual humans on how they feel and not these kind of coordinated manipulative campaigns. And something kind of that makes this even worse is that extreme viewpoints can be normalized when we think we're around others who hold those views. So they're kind of the views we hear help shape what we consider the range of acceptable or normal views. And so on a very kind of serious and sad note, there's been this increasing and radicalization happening online of kind of people being radicalized into white supremacist terrorism and other incredibly, incredibly destructive philosophies. So, I guess, year and a half ago, there was a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue in which 11 people were murdered by a anti semitic white supremacist. And he was someone that had been very, very active on social media even posting directly directly before committing the shooting. Last year there were shootings at two mosque in New Zealand, and the New York Times and 49 people were murdered. The New York Times characterized this a mass murder of and for the internet. The attack was teased on Twitter announced on the online message board. Sorry, I'm going to remove people have been saying to not even name the boards because you don't want to encourage new people to go there and I need to update my slides but on an anonymous message board and broadcast live on Facebook. The footage was then replayed endlessly on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit and the social media platforms were all trying to take down the footage but it was kept being uploaded. So this is something that is already incredibly tragic and harmful that is happening online. I think it just adds kind of another scary element of how manipulative campaigns to influence public opinion and to radicalize people could be just even kind of further amplify this destruction. So let me go to the chat. Oh, okay. This is a great question and I am going to get there shortly what happens when there is no perceptible difference between real and fake pros are there efforts of digital signing of content to verify its origin. This is something that experts that I respect have proposed that we need digital signatures in particular, Zainab Tafekci wrote about that and wired. She uses this analogy. I'll have this in a later slide of you know a long time ago. Like if you didn't know if someone was still alive they could like hold up a photo with the day's newspaper kind of proving they were alive on that day and already with Photoshop that that doesn't make as much sense anymore. But how can we kind of verify and so she says we need to move to verification systems or an SONI head of the Allen Institute on AI wrote a great article on this on HBR last year that I think I quote later, but that's one effort. And I'll talk about some kind of other proposals towards solutions, but I do think that's a promising one. Let me just keep an eye on time. So we have about six minutes left. When I shall pause for a moment to see if there are other questions we will continue this next week and next week I'll get into kind of Steps towards solutions. So maybe I'll just briefly show you. So I'll come back to this. So I have this section on what should we do. I will come back to this but in more detail next time. Basically a few approaches. So their efforts to detect fakes and disinformation, which is an arms race and that's not to say that we shouldn't do it at all. We should be mindful that that is not going to fully solve our problem. And in particular, if you're familiar with GANs and the idea is you have kind of two different models that are both Kind of using the feedback from the other to get even better. And so your, your model that's generating fakes can kind of use the feedback from the detector to get even better at generating fakes. And that's why this this will always be an arms race. There's also responsible development tools. So I'll recommend Aviv Avadia who does kind of research on this of if you're a researcher. So if you're working on something like Adobe's Photoshop or anything to develop synthetic videos or deep fakes. What are the responsible ways to do that that will Hopefully at least like again, this is not going to solve it but limit some of the misuse. We need to address the broader ecosystem. So I talked about these misaligned incentives of how Kind of it's just, it's so profitable to kind of to do the wrong thing. And so addressing that as a kind of underlying problem. Treating treating this as a cybersecurity issue and Renee de Resta and Mike Godwin have written about that. And this can involve a number of things of, you know, red teaming like intentionally kind of looking for the The ways, the ways things can go wrong. I've been very proactive about that and then verification tools as Kevin suggested. So I'll go into more detail about all of those next time. And actually I perhaps we'll stop here today. But so yes, I will Know this is a Kind of pretty serious serious lecture in terms of some of the content that there. There are approaches. There are researchers working on them, although there's a lot more that needs to be done and I would say all of these tools have kind of some incomplete completeness in terms of in terms of the the final outcome. So I'll just pause and see if there there any final questions for today. Alright, yeah. So I mean, feel free to reach out to me during the week. Definitely, if you have not created your account for the forums yet please do so. Feel free to start a topic to discuss any of these issues that you're interested in discussing I will I will share the recording of the the presentation with all of you because I believe this was recorded. I'll post that on the forums as well. See that as a question. Yeah. Thank you everyone. And yeah, well, I'm sad that we can't we can't be together in person, even though it's absolutely the most responsible thing for everyone to be Keeping their social distance right now. I hope that we can really have a kind of good virtual connection and discussion about all of this. So thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.0, "text": " Cool.
