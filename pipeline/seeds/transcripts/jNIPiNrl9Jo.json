{"text": " Hi, this is Jeremy Howard and this is episode one of my new podcast, Their Life and Work. In this podcast I'm going to be interviewing people who inspire and interest me. I want to find out all about their life and work because I'm just fascinated by these interesting and inspiring people. Why do a podcast? Well partly I guess it's a bit of an excuse. An excuse to talk to people that I really want to talk in depth with. But partly because it's kind of how I've lived my life. I always look for things that are interesting and inspiring to do on the basis that maybe other people will find the work I create interesting and inspiring as a result. So I figured, yeah, if I find these people interesting and inspiring, maybe some of you will as well. I've been lucky enough to meet a lot of fascinating people in my life and I guess that's because I've had a perhaps unusually diverse background in terms of what I've done and where I've been. I founded five successful companies, two in Australia and three in the US, including in medical AI. A company also called Kaggle in the data science space and nowadays my focus is in deep learning. I run a research lab called Fast AI, as well as also being a honorary professor at the University of Queensland. I spent 10 years of my life recently in San Francisco, although originally I grew up in Australia to where I've now returned. And yeah, certainly got to meet a lot of really interesting people during that time in San Francisco where interesting people seem to flock, which is something really great about it. Because I'm a dad of a seven-year-old lovely girl who we homeschool. So you'll probably get a sense that the kind of stuff I'm likely to be interested in talking about during these podcasts, the kind of people I'm likely to be interested in talking to, might skew a bit towards folks involved in AI and tech and startups and education and homeschooling. Which has lots of links into my first guest. So for episode one, I'm going to talk to one of the most inspiring people I know and his name is Tanishq Abraham. Tanishq is only 19 and yet he's already achieved an extraordinary amount in his life. I feel sure he's going to achieve a whole lot more in the coming years and so I feel very proud that I almost get to be like his first biographer here, telling you a bit about this amazing person and how he's got to be where he is. So what makes Tanishq interesting? Well I mean apart from anything else, consider who he is right now and what he's doing. He's 19 years old and he is about to finish his PhD, which is quite extraordinary. And he is about to start his first job as the founding CEO of MedArc, a very hot medical AI research group connected to stability AI. You might have come across them through all the recent kerfuffle about stable diffusion, the very exciting models that can create pictures just from a description. So Tanishq is doing very exciting research and very exciting work. His research is in the area of applying AI to medicine and specifically to medical imaging in pathology. This is an area I've actually done quite a bit of work in myself. So I've got a lot of connections with Tanishq, not only because he himself was homeschooled and I'm now a homeschooling dad, so I'm very interested in that aspect of things. Also the fact I started a medical AI company, in fact the first company to focus on applying deep learning to medicine. And this is the area of his research and the area of the company that he will be the founding CEO of very soon. And also the fact that actually the way I first got to know him is that he was a student of fast.ai, the courses that I create through my research and teaching group fast.ai. And so I was quite struck when I first met Tanishq a few years ago. He was one of the youngest people to be doing our courses. Our courses are really actually quite advanced and they're generally designed for people with quite a bit of background in computer programming and a pretty solid understanding of mathematics. And here he was blitzing our most sophisticated courses as a teenager. In fact probably he must have been maybe 15 or 16 at the time, so that was very striking. And then I discovered that he's actually at that age, he had started doing a PhD in an area I was very interested in, with a very interesting supervisor actually, somebody who I had already known and spoke to during my work. So I was very privileged to get to meet him and I will say over the years that have passed since then, I've really been amazed to see how he has matured into such a thoughtful young man. And I have the privilege of now getting to work with him and we do research together. So if you're interested in finding out more about what makes somebody like this tick and how do they get to be in such an extraordinary position at such an extraordinary age, then you will definitely enjoy this interview. His story starts in a sense actually when he was much younger. He was actually getting national attention even as a nine-year-old. He did some amazing things as a very young chap. For example, here he is giving the youngest ever talk at NASA. My poster topic is about using citizen science programs in studying lunar topography. The two citizen science programs I talk about is Moon Zoo, which is from Zooniverse, a citizen science web portal, and Moon Mappers, which is from Cosmoplus, a developing citizen science web portal. So by the age of nine, Tanish could already been doing some college subjects for a couple of years and this definitely came to the attention of a bunch of folks. And as a nine-year-old, in fact, he was profiled in a YouTube series called Prodigies. Here's a clip from that to get a sense of what he was doing back then. We finished chapter 20, but it's a very important chapter, so let's review that today. So anyone can tell me what are the main types of galaxies? Elliptical. Elliptical galaxies. And? Spiral. And spiral. About one year ago, Tanish became my student in Astronomy 300 and he ended up the class being the student with the highest grade. Which ones are the most common ones in the early universe? Irregular. Irregular. What about today? Which ones do I find most often? North elliptical. North elliptical, right. How many people do you know at the age of seven or eight that can discuss the expansion of the universe? He is different in a positive way. The most fun thing for him is learning. So sometimes when people ask, what do you do for your fun time? He says, I just learn. And then people just can't understand that. Tanish was in my Geology lecture and lab class at American River College. Professor Sterling is actually the one who helped me get into college. I've taken Tanish into my wing because he has such potential. His challenges are that he is at an intellect level here, but yet he's still a very kind and happy eight year old. Another thing that really brought him to the attention of folks all around America as a nine year old was he was part of the TV show called Child Genius. Here is Tanish being introduced on Child Genius. So here's my actual high school diploma. When you meet your competitors though, are you going to hide that you graduated from high school? Why should I keep it a secret? It's already like almost everybody knows it. Yeah, since I just graduated from high school, President Obama sent me a letter. We're running out of wall space and room space here, putting up all his trophies and newspaper articles. And he was jokingly saying, we need a museum now for displaying all these things. He started taking college classes when he was seven, eight years old. I started going to American River College. I've got almost 45 units. I may only be 10, but I've done some really cool stuff. His appearance on Child Genius even ended up with him appearing in talk shows such as Conan O'Brien, where he got to show off some of his science jokes. You have jokes, you have them with you I'm told. You brought some jokes. Yes, I brought some jokes. This will be the first jokes we've heard tonight. Let's can we hear your jokes? Okay. So these are the kind of jokes you like because they're about. Yeah, I've got some science jokes. Okay. All right. Let's hope you understand them. Okay. The first joke is, okay, so why can't you trust atoms? Why can't you trust atoms? I don't know. Because they make up everything. But I think part of what has made Tanishq such a tough and tenacious young man is that his interest in learning required fighting at every step. There seemed to always be this assumption that any kid who really wants to learn must have no life elsewhere or must be getting pushed around by their parents or whatever. He gave a TED talk as a kid in which he started to talk about some of this. Here's a sense of what he was dealing with. When I started out at seven, taking college classes was just for fun. Later on, I decided to get an associate degree in science and then transfer to a four-year university. As an advanced education student, you can only take up to two classes per semester and you're last on priority for registration. It's a struggle getting into the classes you want. So far, I've completed about 30 units, but I still have trouble convincing colleges that I'm old enough to become a full-time student. I wonder why that is. Well, here's a reason I hear often. I should enjoy childhood and have fun. For me, learning about particle physics is fun, but I have other kinds of fun as well. In reality, I'm the one constantly reminding my parents that I want to learn more and more. The reason I'm inspired by Tanishq is not by what he did as a 10-year-old, but by who he is now. He's somebody I work closely with. We chat many times every week and I've known him for quite a few years. He's one of the most tenacious, hard-working and thoughtful people I know. I thought, yeah, I can't think of anybody better to start this podcast series with. I think hopefully by the end of this interview, you'll have a sense of why this is somebody that I really wanted to get to know and to more deeply understand their life and work. So without further ado, here is my interview with Tanishq Abraham. All right. Hello and welcome Tanishq Abraham. Thank you so much for joining us. You are my first guest on this podcast, which is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because you're the first guest on the podcast and a curse because every podcast looks back to episode one and says, oh my God, all the things I got wrong back in those days. So thank you for helping launch us and being a bit of a guinea pig here. Well, yeah, thank you for having me. I'm very excited for this and yeah, hopefully it'll be a very fun experience and hopefully there'll be many more episodes to come. I hope so. Well, maybe this will be so good that people will be like, no, you don't need to do another episode. That was the atomic ideal of a podcast interview and everything down downhill from there. So just stop. Yeah. So Tanishq, yeah, I mean, just tell us a bit about what you're doing in your life right now. Yeah. So I'm a PhD candidate at UC Davis in biomedical engineering. My research is focused on applying deep learning to microscopy and pathology. So medical AI applications. And yeah, I've also been working part time at Stability AI, also working on various AI research projects and medical AI projects. Yeah, that's kind of where I am right now. It's been quite busy, but also very interesting and exciting to be, I guess, working at the forefront of AI research. So I think that's very exciting. And of course- So when you say PhD candidate, you're actually getting pretty close, right? So- Yeah, yeah. I'm planning to finish sometime around May. So that's the plan. So it's coming really close. It's like, you know, six months from now. So, you know, it's like, oh yeah, time was starting to kind of wrap up. It's like trying to finish up the papers that I have. It's like, so it's, yeah, it's getting close. Yeah. Well, congrats and good luck on that. So if you do finish in May, how old will you be at that point? I will still be 19. So my birthday is in June. So the right before my birthday. So I'll still be at 19. So yeah. I mean, everything you described, you know, makes you a very interesting person to talk to from a vocational point of view anyway, but doing all that at the age of 19, I think is particularly interesting. And I both like, do you want to talk about that? But almost also kind of don't. I do in the sense that like, I do think it's really interesting. And I think I would love to hear more about it, but I also don't want to pigeonhole you as being like, yeah, you know, you're, you know, X, I guess you're not a child anymore. So X child genius slash prodigy. But like, yeah, the work you're doing is just to be clear, I think it's extremely valuable and interesting independently of the fact that you're 19. It's particularly interesting if you're 19. Does that make sense? No, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Like, I mean, I kind of struggle with the same thing. It's like, yeah, like there's part of me that's like, yeah, like I guess I'm kind of known for this sort of, you know, how I've been as a child prodigy or whatever. But then also like, you know, kind of want to also be known as, you know, this, you know, good AI researcher or good, yeah, just good researcher, you know, making a difference that way. So, but like, I also appreciate the sort of background that I have. Right. So it's like the sort of balance of, you know, I guess who I am as a person, like, yeah, and how I'm represented. It's like, so I think there's a kind of a balance there where like, yeah, I definitely don't want to pigeonhole as just, you know, a child prodigy, but like also, yeah. I mean, also, and we'll talk about this more later, but like, I get the impression that you're very much a product of, or a proud part of a family unit, which has been, you know, very much a part of your path to this point, you know, and your sister is also doing amazing things and in a sense to kind of wipe away the fact that you did all this at, you know, at a young age would almost be to ignore the amazing work and support that your family has provided. Does that, does that seem? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think, I think my parents, I kind of, that's kind of the perspective that my parents have, I think, on this thing. So there's also, yeah, I mean, of course they've, you know, they've made a lot of sacrifices and they've put in a lot of work to help me reach where I am right now. So, and the same is true, of course, for my sister. So I think, yeah, you know, they're also, you know, very proud of, of the accomplishments that we've done at such a young age. So yeah, that's a, that's a, that's definitely a huge factor. And I think, yeah, it's of course. Let's talk about your sister for a moment. So yeah, so yeah. What's your sister's name and what's she doing and how old is she? And yeah, tell me, tell me about that too. Yeah. My sister, she, my sister is Tiara Abraham. She is a, she's 16 years old and right now she's doing her master's at Indiana University in vocal performance. And so, yeah, she, you know, she's, she's also kind of a child, she's a child prodigy in her own right in terms of she's been singing since she was about like maybe like five years old and, you know, she, she's gone professional vocal training and, you know, she's sung in many different venues. She's, for example, sung the national anthem at, you know, very like at the Giants game, S of Giants and, you know, at various different locations. And then she's sung at different concerts and like, of course, like Carnegie Hall. And there's like, there's this big music hall in Austria, a music very, there's like various halls that she's, she's also sung. And yeah, she's, she's a very good singer. She's interested in opera singing. So that's kind of what she's pursuing right now at Indiana University, Jacobs School of Music. It's like one of the best music schools in America for, especially for this sort of opera music. So you must be very proud of your little sister, Taneshka. Yeah, yeah. I can see, I'm just talking on and on about her. No, that's great. I love it. I mean, I, yeah, of course I met you guys and your parents when you came to San Francisco. And I remember that was actually because Tiara was, yeah, looking at like where, where to go to school. I think you might've been looking at Berkeley as well at that time. Yeah. At that time she was actually looking for her undergrad school. So yeah, that was in 2019. Yeah. And I remember saying to you guys like, oh, I, you know, where should we meet? And I was like, oh, I really like bubble tea. Should we go to bubble tea? And I swear both you guys, your eyes lit up with like, oh, we love bubble tea. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we love boba tea and it's like, yeah, we, we really enjoy that. It's funny, actually. I only started, like we first had our first boba tea like in 2018 or so. Like a friend of mine was like, yeah, we should go try it. And I was like, and it was like amazing. And so like a lot of times we will, if we are traveling around and we see a bubble tea location, we'll, we'll give it a try. I've got to admit, I thought it was the weirdest sounding thing ever. And I ignored it for a very long time. Like, where tea with like tapioca star balls. Yeah, no, not for me. Thanks. But it's funny because the tapioca balls are like the best part of it. It's like, oh yeah, I like getting on the tapioca balls. Of course. Absolutely. And just the fact that you've got these awesome straws that are tapioca. Exactly. Yeah, that's great. And then, you know, generally bubble tea places also have extremely evil fried food options as well, which is always, always good. So to be clear. Yeah. I mean, for people that don't know, I, I'm a university professor that works in Tunisia's field. Very closely actually to Tunisia's field. So not just AI and not just deep learning, but specifically having done not just work in medical AI, but quite a bit of work in microscopy. So we, we chat nowadays, what four days a week, you know, about the work we're doing, which is super fun. And it's like one of the delightful things about the world that we're now in, that we get to have this amazing, you know, collegial relationship, despite the fact we, we live in different parts of the world, we're very different ages, we're very different life stages. We don't work for the same companies at all. Like, I don't know, I guess like maybe you've almost grown up with that or does that strike you as kind of like amazing and unusual as well? Well, yeah, I don't know. I guess, I mean, I think, yeah, part of it is just the power of technology and part of it is just me also, like, I'm just like always trying to reach out to people and try to interact with lots of people from different backgrounds. So like, that's kind of the thing that I enjoy. So and that would have been harder a few years ago, you know, when we didn't have video conferencing and. Yeah. So, but yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, I think, yeah, especially since the pandemic and all this video conferencing has happened, that has definitely opened up more opportunities for this sort of work. Yeah. And of course, like even the opportunity for remote jobs and things like that, like I'm working part time with this, with this AI company and, you know, I'm obviously working remote, like the company's technically based in UK, but like the entire company, like most of the company, you know, like all the, almost all the researchers are like in various different parts of the world. And, and that, I don't, I think they kind of came about because of, you know, I guess it was like a lot of these AI communities kind of sprouted during this, you know, pandemic. And so a lot of these kind of open source, decentralized communities, it only happened because of the pandemic. And I think at that time, a lot of us were bored and, you know, interested in like, you know, what can we do? And so that kind of led to this whole, you know, decentralized community happening, these sorts of communities happening. And now that that's become kind of the norm now, which is, I think it's a great thing. Well, a norm for some people, but I mean, I think for a lot of people listening to this, it wouldn't be very normal at all. I mean, for me, it's like been normal for a long time. My first company, Fastmail, was, well, you know, my school, old school friend who I started with was local, but everybody else was spread around the world. And we had all just met over the internet. That was 1999. I'm trying to remember, I guess we, well, a lot of us, we never even really spoke directly over even Skype or anything. It was all just text chat, email. I worked really well. Yeah. I've always liked being able to choose who I work with based on who's the best person to work with rather than who happens to live nearby, you know? Yeah. Yeah. The other thing I've noticed, at least for myself, is like, I find like, you know, I think asynchronous chatting or whatever, it feels like sometimes it's easier to, I don't know, reach out to people and to like interact with people. I feel like, yeah, of course, it's easier that they're just available. You can just send them a message and like, yeah. But it's like also like, I don't know, I feel like it gives you more, I feel like I'm more open to be able to, you know, interact with people like otherwise I may feel like, you know, I think especially with platforms like Discord and things like that. I think the thing is like, things like email feel very like professional. You kind of like have to be like, you know, you want it to be all professional, but something like these sorts of platforms like Discord and I guess there are other different platforms like that. It's like, you can just like quickly send them a message. I mean, it is particularly Discord, right? Like, I think it's particularly Discord. Let's just clarify. So the way you and I interact with our little community, you know, is we have a kind of a Discord text chat where we kind of, you know, cause we're all over the world, literally, you know, Africa, Europe, Australia, US, different time zones. So we say, oh, here's something I tried. Here's some pictures of it. Here's a link to the code, whatever. And then we have our, you know, whatever, four days a week video chat. And I do think that video chat adds a lot as well. Like, I feel like it's, I don't know. I really, yeah, I really like that lower latency communication channel as well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just to be clear, like, it's not just us doing Discord, but like a lot of these open source AI communities use Discord. And it's like, yeah, like nowadays you'll see like cutting edge research being shared in Discord channels, which is like, kind of like, it feels like now, you know, like I think it's normal, but like when you take a step back, you realize that's kind of absurd, right? Like, well, I mean, not just shared, but developed. So let's talk. Okay. So let's talk about, I mean, you were very, very modest about, you know, this AI venture you're involved in. So to be clear, the AI venture is stability AI, and it's not just some hokey little thing. It's actually, I don't know, I would argue it's maybe the most cutting edge, exciting AI startup in the world. It's, and you're not just working there part time. You are leading the medical AI group there. So just getting that out of the way. But yeah, it's kind of like that stability AI. A lot of it happens over Discord because the people are, yeah, they're all over the world and there's constantly folks saying what experiment they're going to try running or the results they've just got or so forth. Yeah. So I mean, do you want to talk more about, yeah, what that, how that works and what that feels like? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Like I think, so with stability AI and the research groups under stability AI, they're mostly these sorts of communities that are effectively, you know, for the most part, just Discord servers. I think now as the company is growing, you know, there may be some aspects of becoming a little bit more formal, but for the most part, these are like open Discord servers where, you know, pretty much anybody can drop in and they can help out as they want. Of course, there are some people who are going to be employed by stability AI, but there are other people who are just, you know, volunteering, sharing their expertise. So oftentimes you'll just have, you know, people. They're often academics, right? Who are kind of like, yeah, it's not exactly volunteering. It's more like actively collaborating with people who aren't necessarily at the same university. So like there are people who are completely new, well, not completely new. I mean, they still have some, you know, they're taking classes or whatever, but they want to get their hands dirty in actual research and they're able to get involved and, you know, work on research projects. But then there are also people who are actual AI researchers, you know, academics, or maybe even sometimes even people from AI startups or AI companies. And they're also able to get involved and help out, you know, and blend their own expertise. So it's like, you know, a mix of different groups. And I think it's good that we have this sort of mix of different groups because you have different perspectives that you can get as well. And you know, a very diverse set of perspectives, which I think is very important for any sort of research project to be able to have that set of, you know, that sort of diversity. And I think that being open, you know, having a sort of open environment through this sort of Discord server really enables and fosters that kind of collaboration and diversity. So like it seems to be working quite well. So there are a few, I mean, I can talk a little bit about some of the research organizations. There's Ingliser AI. Let's come back to that later maybe. Because, yeah, I'm actually, you know, I feel like having got a sense of like what you're working on now at a high level, I'm actually, I want to come back to that. But first I want to, I'm really keen to learn more about you, Tanishq. Okay. And I think a good way to find out about people is, you know, to do a bit of a biography, you know, talk about the chronology of your life, which I'm sure will have lots of interesting facets. But yeah, first of all, maybe you can tell me a bit about the family that you come from. You know, I believe you were born in the US, but yeah, I mean, where were you born and where did your parents come from and what were they doing with their lives before you came on the scene? Yeah, sure. So, you know, I'm Indian. My parents are both Indian, born in India. And then, of course, my mom's background, so my mom's background is in veterinary medicine. My mom did her degree in India. And then my dad's background, my dad technically did a bachelor's in electrical engineering. But then right after my dad left university, he got hired to do more software engineering stuff. And ever since then, he's been working in software. So he must have been very, quite an early software engineer. Yeah. Do you know what he was working on? Yeah, so this is like maybe late 80s, early 90s, late 80s, probably. Okay, so not too early then. Yeah. So I forget exactly which part of India was that. So yeah, both of my parents are from Kerala, which is like the southern state of India. And so, yeah, like my mom went to veterinary school over there. And it's like one of the leading veterinary schools in the country. And actually, my grandparents, my mom's parents are also like, they're also veterinarians. They're also really accomplished people. Like my grandmother, she was like the first woman veterinary PhD or something like that. Yeah, she was like, kind of also like a trailblazer. And then also my grandfather was... Oh yeah, my grandmother, like apparently she discovered a new virus. And yeah, she's done a lot of work as well in veterinary medicine. And also my grandfather also. Then I think, yeah, at one point, my grandfather and grandmother, they worked in Nigeria. And so my mom and her family were living in Nigeria for a few years. But they were like in the government, like one of the top of veterinary medicine in the entire country. And so they're very accomplished people in veterinary medicine. My mom was also kind of working at veterinary medicine or studying veterinary medicine. And then my mom came to the US and met my dad and got married. So my dad was working in software engineering for a bit. And he was working, they were in upstate New York, which is like in Utica, which is like And what brought them to America? Oh, well, so my dad was actually kind of was brought up in America. So my dad's family moved to America when he was in middle school or so. So my dad was brought up actually in America. So my dad used to live in... Sorry? Yeah, what prompted that move? I don't know exactly. So my dad's mother or my grandmother, she was working as a nurse in America. And yeah, I guess for better opportunities. Yeah, so they moved to America. But then my mom only moved after she completed her veterinary degree. And then when she came to America, she met my dad and got married. So yeah. And then so they were living in Utica, which is like upstate New York, really freezing cold weather. Then I think my dad's company, I kind of, I think at least I think that dad facility shut down, something like that. So they were going, they had to find a new place. And they were tired of the freezing cold weather. So my dad managed to find a job here. Yeah, he found a job in Davis, in California. And so that's near San Diego, right? That's near Sacramento. So right. I remember now. Yeah. Yeah. So it's about... Inland from San Francisco. Yeah, it's about like an hour northeast of San Francisco. And so, yeah, my dad found a job there in Davis and they found a house in Sacramento. Well, yeah, they're personally living in an apartment and then they found a house in Sacramento. So since then, they've been in Sacramento. So that's been about like 25 years or so, something like that. So, and my, yeah, well, my dad has been working at, yeah, basically my dad's been working at this company for, I guess, I think this year was 26 years. So yeah, like 26, 26 or 27. It's 26 years. Yeah. 26 years. So, I've been working at the same company for 26 years, which is like nowadays, that is unheard of, obviously. Absolutely. Especially in California. Especially in California. What is your earliest memory, Tanishq? My earliest memory? I mean, I have like some really vague memories, maybe like, I don't know, maybe like three or four years old, like really vague memories. But I think a lot of my earliest memories were, well, yeah, I do remember like a little bit in preschool, so I must have been four. So I do remember a little bit in preschool. Yeah. Tell me, what do you remember about preschool? Many ago, just like, I guess, playing around, like, I guess when my parents would pick me up from preschool and just like, I guess, certain, yeah, it's like very vague, but still like I kind of remember it. Yeah. I think a lot of my memories were more probably from kindergarten onwards. I think that's kind of where, yeah. Yeah. Now, okay, so this is interesting. So you went to preschool, you went to kindergarten, but I know in the end you did homeschooling, right? So when did that switch happen and why? Yeah. So I think it's like worth talking about like when maybe my parents realized I was, I guess, different or special or whatever and how that kind of resulted in how that affected my education. But like, so like my parents realized I was different, like from very early on, I guess maybe, you know, when I was a few months old, because like, for example, my mom would like test my comprehension. So like, for example, reading picture books or like, yeah, showing picture books to me and different things like that. And my mom would like ask questions and stuff. And I was able to like, you know, point out things and kind of respond. So like my mom was like, yeah, I'm not sure if this is normal for like someone who's only a few months old. And I guess it was, I guess, yeah, it is kind of a little bit. Yeah. But it's interesting she figured out it's not, you know, because like, for me as a parent, my daughter who's seven sounds like she's at a very similar level to where you were when you were seven, which is like you were doing some college courses. And my daughter Claire's also doing some college courses. And so like, I would say she's, you know, her academic progress recently has been unusual. But I didn't, neither me or my wife saw that at all early on. And I have no idea if that's because she wasn't doing anything exceptional or just we had no idea what was normal. So it's interesting that your parents were able to recognize that it was unusual because as a parent, you don't actually have anything to compare to. At least that's my experience. Yeah, that's true. Like, I think my dad was a little bit more like hesitant. It was like, I don't know, like, you know, all parents think their children are special, right? So I think my dad was a little bit hesitant at first. But my mom was like more convinced, like, yeah, maybe there's something different. And like, so yeah, and then eventually, like, so first of all, like, my mom was like doing her PhD and, yeah, my mom did like, yeah, my mom was doing, my mom did like a master's degree at UC Davis. So I guess when my dad and my mom moved to Sacramento and Davis, you know, my mom was able to do some studies there. But like, my mom was in her, the middle of her PhD. In veterinary studies? Yeah, well, it was technically like comparative pathology or something like that. But yeah, it was, yeah. But yes, my mom was doing her PhD when she was pregnant with me. So originally, the plan was to take a few months off or like a year off or something like that and go back to completing the PhD. But then I think when my mom realized, oh, well, maybe there's something special about about me or something different about me, that my mom decided to actually quit the PhD and become a stay-at-home mom just to be able to support me and, you know, make sure I get the support that I need. So that's like a really bold thing to do. Like I mean, obviously selfless, but like parents are expected to be selfless, you know, but yeah, bold in the sense that like speaking as a parent, you know, as soon as our daughter could go to a normal school, which was rather delayed because of COVID, that COVID would have been the first year and all the schools were closed in San Francisco. We sent her to a normal school because that's what you do, you know. And it wasn't until we had like, I don't know, maybe it sounds really slow, but it was like basically a year of realizing things, like it didn't go terribly. She was happy, but it didn't go great. And she definitely never learned anything and her only comments about the classes were that they were boring. Yeah, yeah. And it was really a year of like not great progress that we finally thought, okay, maybe this is not the best environment for her. So I mean, yeah, your mom, yeah, she really took a bold step very, very early. It's amazing to me. Yeah, yeah. It's amazing. It is kind of amazing because of course, yeah, like I think also, you know, my mom did definitely did have great career opportunities waiting for her if that was something my mom wanted to pursue. But instead, my mom decided instead to focus on me at the time. And of course, my sister later on. So yeah, it is definitely a huge sacrifice on her. But also a huge amount of self-confidence, right? Because it's hard as a parent, I find it hard as a parent to do things that are like totally different to what everybody else in the community is doing. Because there's always, for me, this second guessing of like, oh, I don't want to do weird things and make my child weird and like not give them the best opportunities. And so there's always this very natural draw towards like just doing what everybody else is doing. The basis can't be that bad. So yeah, I mean, she had a lot of self-confidence to do something that is, yeah, it's unusual. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And of course, I mean, of course, it's not just my mom. Of course, my dad also was, after some point, my dad was also quite convinced too. So I think, you know, together as a family. So initially, did your mom have to convince your dad? Is that your understanding? I'm not entirely sure. But like, I mean, I've heard from my, you know, I've heard from them like, yeah, originally, you know, my dad was like, maybe, you know, all parents think their children are special, maybe not necessarily. And I think, you know, maybe after a bit, my dad, I think, you know, of course, they did their own research in terms of like child development and things like that at that young age. And I think from that point onwards, and also eventually, this was like later on. I mean, wait, that's it. I mean, that's interesting. That's already interesting. Because, I mean, it may sound like an obvious thing to do is to research child development. And I certainly did a lot of research into child development, but very few parents I've spoken to actually spent time researching child development. You're like, that's interesting. What do you know about that? What did they do? I don't know a lot about that, to be honest. I think, yeah, I think they did, like, thankfully, of course, with the internet, you know, there were already some resources available and everything. I think they may have talked to one or two people. I'm not entirely sure, honestly. But then I think eventually, then they decided finally to do an IQ test with me. This was like when I was three or four years old. So this was like a little bit later on. But I think they just kind of wanted to, like, yeah, but like my mom was like, just doing this just to. Yeah, our daughter didn't get one until she was six. And it was only because her school told us they should do it. And we were like, why bother doing that? But actually, it's really helpful. Yeah, it's not like my mom needed that to be certain. Like, I think it's just more like, also like certain. So like, for example, we had like wanted to, I think my mom wanted to get me into Mensa at the time because my mom thought, okay, they might provide some, you know, useful resources and help with things. Honestly. That is so dopey, right? I mean. You know, so my mom had some high hopes about that. So for that, like, that was maybe one of the reasons I think that my mom got, like, just because they require those sorts of things. But so like, never just like, yeah. But so I mean, of course, that like definitely, you know, showed that I was, you know, confidently show, you know. Yeah. I mean, let's talk about that for a moment. Let's talk about that for a moment, because it's like, it's really something that really resonates. I mean, as I say, as a parent, like. So yeah, for our daughter, her assessment showed she's in, I don't know, the top 0.000, I don't know how many 0's, 1%. And I kind of, what felt like, or wanted to feel like, that doesn't matter. I mean, she was very well adapted at school. She had a lot of friends, people liked her, you know. At one level, everything seemed fine. But at another level, she was spending hours every day sitting in a classroom where she was learning nothing at all. And she was just basically practicing, learning how to zone out and always be right, which I think is terrible psychologically to always be right, you know, because you fear being wrong. And you know, the school had a gifted program that like, for the top 10% of students, and it's like, well, what about the top 10% of the top 10% of them? They are different, you know, those children have different needs, not necessarily socially, but you know, to be challenged and to be, you know, what counts as compelling content. So yeah, I definitely feel like it's mattered for us in a way that I didn't at all expect, almost feel a bit uncomfortable with. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Like, yeah, I don't know. Like, I mean, yeah, I don't care about my IQ. I don't think my parents like, were that concerned about it or like, you know, they couldn't, yeah. But it's mattered for, I guess, yeah, for these sorts of things. And yeah, in terms of like... I mean, it's not something to be proud of, but it's something that's definitely impacted... Yeah, yeah, exactly. You know, how you have lived your life and how your parents have structured your life. So like, clearly it matters in some way, right? Yeah, I guess it matters, but like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. But in terms of like, yeah, what my parents were like, I guess, yeah, going back to like, when I started going to like preschool and kindergarten, like they wanted to, of course, challenge me. Of course, like socially, you know, I was, they wanted to, of course, give that social development to me as well. Like, you know, make sure I have that social development. So you know, they tried their best, you know, to set up something special with the school. So I think, you know, especially like at kindergarten, and then I think also, so like in kindergarten, I think also second grade. So I actually skipped first grade, I went to second grade. So I think in those two grades, like I was doing like, sort of like, I would only go maybe two or three times a week. And that was mainly just for the social aspect, right? Because I'm not like learning anything new. Yeah, it's amazing how similar that is to Claire. She skipped prep once she did go to school and jumped into first grade, although she was doing, but then for math, they put her in fifth grade. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I definitely felt as a parent, like, oh, I don't want her to miss out on social development. Yeah. So then, yeah, that's what they, yeah, that's what my parents tried to do to still give me that social development. So, you know, I'd still have, try to have friends at school. And but then they, you know, of course, at home, I was studying my own, at my own level. And then I would, I would participate in some of those gifted programs. Like, there was like a reading program where I would be again, reading at like, you know, fifth grade level that I'm reading at when I'm in kindergarten. Similar with, you know, math. And then also, I think like when I was in second grade, my parents were able to set up at the school something where like, I would be, I would go to like the eighth grade class for science or something like that. And was like participating in a few of their activities and stuff. So I'll tell you the challenge we faced with that, which I'm guessing you might've seen something similar, your parents might've seen something similar, which is, you can put, you know, you can accelerate a kid to a high of nuts, you know, but it's not that that kid is like statically more advanced by X amount. It's that they, you know, pick things up quicker. And so like, at least with Claire, she was put into grade five, you know, when she was meant to be in, for math, when she was meant to be in grade prep, and for a month that was cool. And she was interested. And after a month she was bored again. And like, we didn't, we didn't find any, yeah, these programs tend to be like kind of a static amount of enrichment on top of what they'd otherwise be doing, but it doesn't seem to account for this continuous acceleration where they're doing like a year's worth of learning every month or two. Like that doesn't seem to fit very well with any of these programs. Yeah, well, the thing was, like, my parents tried to like do something very special and like very cheap, like something catered specifically to me. And they tried to work that out with the school for a long time. I had a lot of meetings with, you know, people at the school. But then eventually, then the school was very, at a certain point, they kind of weren't as flexible and they just kind of did not want to, you know, support whatever my parents thought would be best for me. Yeah. And it sounds like they'd made quite an effort. They kind of said the same thing about our child's school. Yeah, and they need some effort. But again, that was after a lot of my parents pushing them, right? This was like, my parents put a lot of work, you know, they had several meetings. I mean, I still kind of vaguely remember like some of the meetings, but they were like really like trying to, you know, argue it out with some of the folks at the school. Yeah. I mean, that's such a common story. I've heard so many parents say, yeah, they like, the advocacy is exhausting and demanding. Yeah, it is exhausting. Yeah, I remember that being the case for my parents. And the only reason my parents kept me in the school was because of the social aspect of things. But then as I, so like, the thing was like with the second grade, the teacher was very supportive. So that really helped. Then as I went into third grade, the teacher was not at all supportive. Yeah. Some teachers almost seem to be antagonistic or threatened or something. Like some teachers really seem to react negatively. Yes, yes. I think they do feel kind of threatened that like, maybe they're not the ones who are teaching or like, you know, or like, you know, maybe they feel like, yeah, threatened, like, oh, this is like a know-it-all kind of kid or something like that. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, we had something like that with Claire. And there was, you know, her school on the whole was trying really hard and they, there was actually a gifted program in high school that they put her into when math was not too boring. And yeah, it was like, oh, this is cool, you know, like two years of high school math in one year and it'd be challenging. And then there was a change of headmaster at the high school and it was weird the way he took this like personal interest in like getting rid of our daughter out of school. It's like he sent us this email and like, and like sent an email to the primary school. And yeah, he just seemed really offended by the fact that there was a young child studying math in his school in a way that I just, I didn't understand how he was thinking about it. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, I don't understand. And I think that's what happened in third grade. And yeah, like the second grade teacher was very supportive. And I think some of the folks at the school were supportive, but then as went into third grade, I think there were also some of the staff also changed and those folks were, yeah, less supportive. They felt threatened. And then also, I don't know what it is, but like, you know, the students also were very antagonistic towards me at that point. And I was getting- Wow, already at that age? Yeah. Yeah. I was getting bullied. I mean, I kind of remember like, there were times where like, for example, some of the students would like steal my supplies. Then some of them would like try to like, like they would quiz me like mental math. And like, if I didn't answer, they'd be like, oh, you're not smart or things like that. And like, I'm a kind of person who's like actually pretty bad at mental math, to be honest. I've like- That makes sense. That's like 100,000 things I'm not very good at. So like, you know, that was, you know, not a very good, yeah, it was very, I guess, yeah, the entire environment kind of became toxic. And I was not enjoying going to school. Like before I used to like, enjoy going to school, you know, I had some friends, you know, I thought it was, you know, it was just for me to have fun. I mean, third graders must be learning this attitude from somewhere, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's what I think. I think part of it does come from both, you know, the parents, maybe, you know, there's some aspect from the parents, again, from the staff, the teacher, I don't know. But I think there's, of course, some aspect where it's like, yeah, they are learning it, you know, from, yeah, other figures. Yeah. So at that point, like, I was not enjoying going to school. Yeah, no, okay. I can get why your mom did homeschooling at that point. Because it sounds like this is not working out at all. Exactly. I mean, they tried their best to get it to work, but it just didn't work. So they were like, yeah, we're gonna take him out of school and homeschool him. So let me just take a diversion for a moment then, just because I've been, as I said, studying a lot of the research around education and child development. And as I expect you to know, the reality is that on pretty much only any socialization or social measure, homeschooling kids on average come out ahead of kids that go to normal schools. So that's the other thing when we were like, oh, maybe we should homeschool Claire. It's like, oh no, what if she turns out to be some kind of weird freakoid who doesn't know how to deal with people? That's not what the research shows at all. Indeed, you don't seem to have come out as a weird freakoid who can't deal with people. Or at least if you are, you seem to be able to hide it very well. Yeah. I mean, that's definitely been the complaint everyone says. You look at, especially when I was younger, that was one of the questions everyone had. What about his social skills? You see in interviews, you look at the comments on any of these interviews. I mean, obviously I'm not affected by any of these comments or anything, but it's just kind of funny to just see everyone's like, what about his social skills? I'm like, you don't need to worry about that. But yeah, I think when I was younger, of course, my parents had given me different opportunities for social skills. So I used to go to the San Francisco Boys Chorus. I was in the chorus for quite some time. So that was happening while I was homeschooled. And so that was one opportunity for me to socialize. But then I think it's also like, I guess I didn't have any issue. As I started out college and stuff like that, I didn't have much issue socializing with people who are twice my age or three times my age. Right. So like, why, you know, a couple of questions, like why would we assume that the best people to socialize with are the people who are, you're saying, chronological age? That doesn't happen in adulthood. We're all kinds of different ages. And B, why would socializing well with seven-year-olds be an important skill when you're 18? Like, yeah, there's a lot of assumptions in there that don't make sense to me. And so like, yeah, homeschooling kids generally seem to have a much wider age group or diversity of people they hang out with rather than people their exact chronological age and go to a school with the same religious profile or whatever as everybody else. Yeah, yeah, that's definitely an important point. So I started out in a community college, which is like in US, that's like the sort of like two-year college, but it's usually like a lot of times, it's not only like students in, so sometimes students in high school will be taking college classes there. Sometimes after high school, they'll spend two years in this college and then go to complete their remaining two years at a regular university. And also there's a lot of students who are coming back for like continuing education and things like that. So a community college has a very diverse group of people. You have students who are like high schoolers. And how old were you when you were starting to go to this community college? I was seven years old. Seven, okay. Yeah. So then there were students who were like in their late teens all the way up to people who may be in their 60s, 70s. So you have this very diverse group of people, very diverse ages. So can I just ask something about this? Just sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to know, my guess would be, tell me if I'm wrong or right, that you wouldn't have had the same problems with bullying as a seven-year-old at a community college because the other kids would have probably seen you more as like a adorable little kid rather than a threat or something. And I would imagine they were on the whole pretty nice to you. Was that? Yeah. For the most part, the students were pretty nice to me. I think also like it was more like, I think, yeah, a lot of students just thought, I think, I'm the kind of student who's very engaged in the class and studying very well. So they also thought of me kind of just as a probably good student in the class and interacted with me accordingly. Occasionally you'll have students who did feel maybe a little bit threatened. That happens occasionally. But I try to avoid that as much as possible. But for the most part, yeah. So I got a bit of an insight into your experience as a seven-year-old because we're lucky enough that you have a recording of you as a nine-year-old describing that experience in a TEDx talk. And I think one of the things that really struck me, or there's a couple of things that really struck me, but one was how much, again, advocacy was required by your parents to get somebody to agree to teach you. Yeah. Yeah. Can you talk a bit about, I mean, obviously it wasn't you doing that, but like, what's your memory of that or what have you felt about that from your parents? What was it like to get, because, okay, just to be clear, my understanding is as a seven-year-old, you were a very good college student, like you got A's and top marks. And so, yeah, maybe talk a bit about like, yeah, what kind of results were you getting? But then what was the experience like of actually getting to attend these classes? Right. Yeah. So, again, at that point, it was, again, my parents are trying to challenge me and, you know, keep me, you know, yeah, you know, try to academically challenge me. So they thought, you know, at the time I was interested like in, of course I was already kind of interested in science, you know, I was interested in like paleontology, astronomy. So they were looking for, and like, you know, I was- Dinosaurs in space are always good kids things. Yeah, absolutely. There's still like an aspect of me being a regular seven-year-old who loves like dinosaurs in space. Well, of course, that's the thing, right? Our daughter's the same. She's such a regular seven-year-old. She likes fairies and unicorns and spaceships and imaginary animal friends. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, yeah, the difference is like, I took it a lot farther than like a regular, you know, seven-year-old. Like I was like really studying everything about dinosaurs and everything about space. Our daughter has watched the entire Professor Dave astronomy video series, like, I don't know, five times and she's always quizzing me about main sequence stars and brown dwarves. And I'm just like, I'm slightly picking things up. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. I remember some of that from my astronomy days. Yeah. So, yeah, I think, I think so at the point was like, the point was like, I had gone through a lot of the material that is available for kids my age, and even like, even kids older than me, in terms of like, reading books about dinosaurs and things like that, you know, even starting to maybe get into a couple of papers and things like that. So they figured, you know, that a better way to potentially challenge me was, you know, going to college. And I mean, I had also asked them about this too. This was something that I myself asked about, you know, this is something that I was, you know, interested in as well. And so, you know, in fact, at first, they didn't take me very seriously. Oh, this kid wants to go to college. That doesn't make any sense. They being your parents or they being? Yeah, my parents, like, even they were like, at first, I don't know, like, sure, you're advanced, but you know, you're still seven. I guess at the time I'd asked, I was maybe like five or six. And they were like, yeah, that's a little bit weird, I guess. Yeah, it is kind of weird. So, but then I think they noticed, like, you know, I'm still like, kind of study this as much as possible. And I, you know, college would be a good opportunity for me to, you know, pursue this further. And, you know, I was asking them relentlessly about this. And so, eventually, the again, contacting some professors, as you can imagine, most of the professors said no. They managed to find one professor who said, said yes. And she agreed to have my mom as a student in the class. And then I just would be part of the, you know, just, you know, going along with my with my mom. So, I wasn't actually at that point an official student. I was just with my mom was a student. And then he would, so I was just sitting in the class. Then when it came to like things like quizzes and exams, just for fun, he would give me those quizzes and exams, and I would take them. And you know, I was getting A grades in all the quizzes and exams. And also, he was very amazed by that. These topics are largely like kind of more like rote learning, really, aren't they? Yeah. So, this was a geology class. So, you know, there was an aspect of it that is rote learning. But also, like, I think there's still some aspect of it that's understanding, you know, the geological processes and how they work and how they interact. But for, yeah, there's a lot. I guess my point being like, I find that for a lot of the stuff Claire's doing, I actually feel like a lot of seven-year-olds could do it because, you know, it's, you know, like I mentioned to you the other day, she's doing biochemistry at the moment and it's largely college level material. Some of it's actually beyond college level material, like chirality and stuff. I think normally you tend to do post-grad, that's my understanding. And yeah, she had to like learn the amino acids, which I think she learned some fast. I didn't know this stuff either, and she learned them faster than me, but it's not surprising because, you know, the young brain does learn things faster than an adult. So I do think that this might also be probably a general thing as kids can perhaps learn more than we expect. Yeah, that's probably true. I think, I don't know, like, you know, what kind of skills are required at these different ages or like, or, you know, develop at different ages. There may be some skills, but yeah, I mean, of course, a lot of the memorization is possible at a young age probably. Yeah, I mean, maybe we can come back to this topic. I'm really interested in talking about it more because, I don't know, I just think it's really fascinating, but yeah, I also don't want to interrupt your story. So yeah, do go on about your college experience. Yeah, so yeah, I was like, yeah, basically I was in the astrology class and, you know, taking a lot of the exams and quizzes and he was, you know, very impressed. So you weren't really officially there. It was really like your mum's doing it and, you know, she has to babysit the kid basically. Yeah, basically. Like, I guess that's how you presented, but yeah, but it was actually secretly it was for you. Yes, exactly. Yeah. So then I think, so at that point, then he was also kind of helping out and becoming an advocate for me as well in terms of like, okay, this is a kid who I think can potentially join this college and take some college classes. What was his background name? Stephen Sterling. He was a geology professor and yeah, so I think he's retired now, but yeah. So yeah, he really was helpful in terms of like talking with the college staff and helping to convince them. But even then, of course, the college staff were still not that convinced. They were like, you have to do well in these classes, otherwise we will not let you continue. So like, I think the expectation was like getting an A basically in the classes. Was that a higher bar than other students would have had? I mean, probably, yeah, I think so. Yeah. So for a while, that's kind of what was happening. And then also they limited me to only taking two classes per semester. So I was only taking two classes per semester. And so, and then basically every single semester, there was a whole process, like I had to go and meet the dean and get permission from the dean. And it was a whole process. And it was like a very special situation. But eventually, like, so I wanted to take more classes and progress faster. Yeah, I mean, two classes a semester is not a lot. Yeah, it's not particularly engaging, I guess. So the idea was then I would graduate high school. So then I would be a regular college student. So this was around the age of nine or ten. Then I managed, so luckily in California, they do have this option to like take a standardized test and test out of high school. But you can only take it if you are in 10th grade. So we had to set it up. I wonder why these limitations exist, where they came from. Because somebody obviously proactively decided to create this gate. It's interesting. And I think it's again, like, they're like, oh, you have to go through a certain amount to have that development that they deem necessary, I guess. I think that's what it is. But so yeah, they had to like, we had to set it up in a specific way such that I was like officially technically in 10th grade. And then eventually I was able to take that test. Yeah, we had to, yeah, there was a way that we had to like, yeah, set it up with some school or something. Yeah, it was another whole process. And then eventually I was able to test out. And so that's some specific Californian thing that makes you like, are you effectively basically just doing the year 12 exams and the normal year 12 exams? I don't think it was a normal year 12 exam. It was specific towards testing out. I think the idea is like, so they'd be allowed for like, grade 10 and 11 students to test out of high school, actually. So this is a test for these sorts of grade 11 and grade 10 and 11 students. So it's kind of more catered towards that particular. Like, there's a separate test actually for regular grade 12 testing out. But luckily, like, I mean, that's kind of still like a benefit of California. Like, I don't know if other states actually have this sort of situation. I've heard of it before. Yeah. I'll ask you about something, which is, I wonder if you had to deal with this at that time. A term that's very often used by psychologists in the field of like, you know, more advanced kids or whatever is asynchronous development. And so asynchronous development refers to the idea that some kids, you know, develop surprisingly quickly in certain areas, but not in others. You know, so for example, for kids that who would often be described as gifted, which is not a term I love, but I guess it's a term that's reasonably well-restored, the asynchronous development often is like, okay, their handwriting's crappy because they're not particularly physically capable. Their understanding of, you know, complex social, political, et cetera, situations, as you might come across in like a Shakespeare play don't really exist, you know, but they have maybe very good understanding of spatial reasoning or abstract manipulation or whatever. So, yeah, so in our life, that asynchronous development is the big challenge because like, I don't feel like I would want Claire doing a, you know, year 12 level English exam where she was expecting to read, you know, books like Othello or something. Because they're just not age appropriate. They're, you know, like reading comprehension, okay, she'd get it, she'd be fine. But like, she's a little kid. And she certainly couldn't do the handwriting necessary for a normal like three hour exam or something. Yeah. Did you have to deal with those kinds of things or was the Californian stuff mainly more like multiple choice analogy tests and stuff? So the California test was, yeah, more like that. I think there's maybe an essay or something like that. But for the most part, it was mostly just testing your knowledge and things like that. But overall, of course, my parents were more careful about what was age appropriate in terms of like classes and things like that. Like even like, for example, English classes, you know, they would review the books, you know, making sure they're age appropriate. You know, certain, you know, there were certain classes like, yeah, the different classes that, you know, my parents, you know, they would talk to the professors and also just clarify with the professors if there's anything to be, you know, to be careful about. And, you know, like maybe there are times when like the professors would show something and, you know, I would step out of the class for a bit while they're showing something that maybe wasn't the most age appropriate. So like, you know, there was definitely that aspect in terms of like what was age appropriate for me at the time. But apart from that, like, again, of course, like handwriting, you know, was also something I like struggled with. But I think that was more like, I do have like some sort of like issue with my hand in terms of like, I don't know, yeah, I have some, you know, issue, like, especially for writing very long periods of time. I much prefer typing and things like that. I mean, yeah, I've absolutely, it's always the same. And we actually got our daughter typing, we got our daughter typing like when she was five, I guess. And it's been such a great skill for her to have because there's so many things she can now do despite her asynchronous development. Because yeah, little kids can type. That was not necessarily an asynchronous thing. It was just more like, I think I do have like, I tend to have like pain or something like this. I don't know. I don't think, yeah, I don't think that was like a development thing. That's just kind of something with my body or whatever. So how did you throw that essay? I don't know, like, I don't know if I had, I thought that I did get like accommodations and things like that in terms of like specifically for this sort of issue. I don't know if I had for that. I'm not entirely sure. But Australia, there's like a specific list of things that count as accommodations, you know, and they're, but, and like, they're disabilities, you know, and you have to be able to show that it's like a, due to an illness. So although like having tiny seven-year-old hands is a disability, but at least in Australia, it doesn't count as one because it's not due to an illness. Oh, okay. Oh, interesting. Okay. Well, it was, yeah. And over here, they counted as a disability actually, when I have it. That makes much more sense. Yeah. But like overall, like apart from like age appropriate stuff, like, you know, being careful about that for the most part, like, and yeah, I guess what they have to think is really not asynchronous development. But apart from that, for the most part, like in terms of development, like for example, I was, oh, like my attempt was like 11, I think or so, like there was one, I took an English class and we went over like, I think it was the Tempest or something like that. So I was like already like reading like Shakespeare plays or whatever. And I didn't have that much issue with those sorts of things. Yeah. I mean, the Tempest is not a particularly, I don't know, like, it feels like a pretty still very dense and accessible story. Yeah. Like, Redalo and Juliet or something or Othello or something might be tougher, I think. But yeah, I don't remember anything. What about math? So yeah, like math is needed for a lot of college level, you know, STEM stuff. Well, not just STEM, but also social sciences as well. So, yeah. What were you doing about that? Were you studying more advanced math and like calculus and trig and stuff? And what, you know, was that like mainly your mom teaching you or how did math work? So like when I was younger, like again, six or seven years old, it was mostly my dad. My dad is the more, I mean, my dad is a software engineer. And of course, he's more, you know, engineering background. He was able to teach the math aspect of things. So, yeah, my dad would help me out then teach me. And there were like different programs that, you know, I was going through in terms of, you know, learning, you know, I think just at the age of five, I was doing again like fifth grade, sixth grade math. But then I would continually progress. I think by nine or 10, I think by nine, I started like, started, you know, dabbling in calculus and that kind of level of stuff. But then like I started taking classes like even online classes and stuff and like pre calculus and I think maybe even some Khan Academy videos, things like that. So I was like, so then by 10, which is when I also graduated high school, I went into yeah, I started taking, I took a proper calculus class. I mean, I had already studied a lot of calculus on my own and stuff like that. But then I actually took a proper college calc. So when you say on your own, that would be largely Khan Academy? Yeah, like I think there was maybe a book that I was reading and then there was like, there was like a Coursera course. I think, yeah, there was like this really nice Coursera course that I took on single variable and multivariable calculus, things like that. So I think it was mostly single variable calculus. So yeah, I was mostly taking just like, yeah, resources online, things like that. And so, and again, like a lot of it is me, like when I'm studying a lot of things, it's like a lot of times it's like me, like I have a goal in mind, right? So like I remember like when I was studying trigonometry, I think this may have been the time of like the transit of Venus or whatever. And there was like the whole thing, you can calculate the distance of the Earth to the sun based on like, you know, the time it takes for the transit and stuff like that. And it was like, there's a lot of trigonometry involved. And so I was like studying trigonometry to understand that kind of stuff. And then I was studying like calculus also to better understand some physics stuff. So a lot of it is me. I mean, that's my like constant goal with teaching my daughter is trying to find those things where she can get to do it in context. Because honestly, like she, so I, for math, I teach her and one other kid, her best friend, and her best friend is totally happy to learn math for its own sake. Like he just has so much joy in being like, oh, I now know a new thing. And my daughter's not like that at all. She just doesn't care until it's got a reason. So we do a lot of art of problem solving. Did that exist when you were? I don't know. I haven't done that. It's amazing. It's, you know, it's a fantastic, it's basically kind of like designed as a kind of math Olympiad prep, but it's like 12 years worth of math Olympiad prep, if you know what I mean. So it's like teaching the entire primary and high school curriculum. Right. But on the assumption that the kids studying it are really interested in solving challenging problems and thinking carefully about them and they're going to continue all the way through. That's done in a very thoughtful way. And it's a great program, but yeah, my daughter's really not interested. Well, so her friend loves it. And then the other day I was like, okay, well, you know, for some reason, oh, that's right. I was having trouble setting up a Factorio computer game server for them. And they were like, why isn't it working? And I was saying like, well, it works if I put in an IP address, but not a DNS name for some reason. And then, and then Claire's just like, what exactly is an IP address? So why, you know, I was like, okay, all right, stop everything. This class is going to be about, you know, IP addresses and we're going to have to do binary masks and we're going to have to do octets and, you know, and now she's totally into it. And like at every step, she's just like, wait, how on earth do multiple things go over the same wire? Like, oh, okay, well that's multiplexing. It's like, what exactly is multiplexing? How does that work? And like, oh, well, okay, let's come up with a little simple algorithm that we could use for multiplexing. And yeah, with context, she's just all over it. And without context, she just doesn't care. So the interesting thing is like, now I feel like I'm like before I came to math, yeah, I was more like, I need to have an application or something to motivate that. Now I feel like I'm kind of interested in not just for the sake of it sometimes. So I don't know, like at a certain point, I think that when I started to age, I guess that maybe changed. I don't know. I am slightly getting there. I wouldn't say, I think I'm still not quite there. Like I had to have math books now that I've purchased for the enjoyment, but they generally were like, you know, using APL or they're like, you know, different perspectives on math or whatever. I'm not somebody who could just study a real analysis textbook and find that a worthy thing to spend my time on. Yeah. So, yeah, so I guess then I guess, so yeah, basically I was studying calculus and then, but I still took an official calculus college course and went through the calculus curriculum or the math curriculum at college. So that included calculus one, calculus two, calculus three. Then I think what else? Then as I was finishing up at community college, I took linear algebra and yeah, took linear algebra and then in university, I, you know, I transferred over to the four-year university. I took a differential equations class and that was it in terms of like my, yeah. Which has turned out to be very useful since we're spending so much time doing differential equations nowadays. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, funny, there's so much stuff that I remember like in the world of math at school or university or whatever, starting basically from trigonometry where, you know, I would ask the teacher like, what's this for? And the teacher could never answer the question of like, what's trigonometry for or what's differential calculus for or what? And now, yeah, these things are everywhere. Like I, you know, use trigonometry all the time. I'm like, how do you do anything without trigonometry or without calculus? But I think a lot of teachers just don't have that real world experience as engineers or scientists so that they genuinely don't know how to answer the question. As in, well, it's going to be on exam. Yeah. Well, yeah. So like some of my classes did, that was some of the classes really nice in terms of like, you know, providing those sorts of examples. So like, you know, sometimes in the calculus textbooks, they would provide, you know, actual examples of where these sorts of things would be used. And I remember in my differential equations class, the professor would start every lecture with like an example of, you know, the topic that we're talking about now, like maybe there's a certain class of differential equations that we're talking about. How was that? How, you know, examples of the use of that in the actual world. And so that's really, really helpful in terms of motivating why these sorts of concepts should be there. That's really rare. Yeah, it is rare. And he's actually, he's a really great professor actually. So who's that, Terry? My differential equations professor. Yeah. What's their name? Oh, William Tabernetti. He's at UC Davis. Yeah. And I just want to come back to Khan Academy as well, and not just Khan Academy, but like, I've asked you previously when we've chatted about online resources, and you've mentioned you use things like Time for Learning and Khan Academy. Did you find that that stuff you did on like Khan Academy or whatever, like was, was useful in preparing you to take stuff like Calculus 1 and things like that? I think it helped. Like I remember doing like, especially like geometry, I think, algebra and geometry. I mean, I learned the concepts, so I don't. So it did the job. Definitely did his job. I also learned some, I think I did some chemistry. Like I used to do a lot of, yeah, I think there was a time when I used to like, I think a nice thing about like Khan Academy and these sorts of lectures and stuff is like, it's very easy to like devour a lot of content, right? And it's like, just like watch video after video and like, and you're just learning all of it. And so that really helps. And then I think nowadays they also have like quizzes and stuff. And I don't know if there were quizzes back then. And me taking some of these quizzes and stuff, that also was helpful. By the way, I, your recommendation of trying out Time for Learning was not successful. I tried it on Claire and afterwards I was like, how was that Claire? What do you think? And she just goes, I think it's stupid. But she never has strong opinions like that about stuff. So I was like, oh, okay. Because like, it's like, I don't know. I might've picked bad examples. I picked the middle school STEM stuff or whatever. Okay. Having said that, we have since that time found some much more engaging YouTube videos from Crash Course and the YouTube Engine Sisters that actually are pretty terrific. And I'm learning. Yeah, Crash Course is really, really nice as well. I remember, I mean, I think I remember watching one of Crash Course videos. I wish they had quizzes though. Like we always put everything, we try to put everything into Anki cards, you know, like space learning cards. Which for math, I kind of do it for them because no one remembers anything unless it's in an Anki card, you know. So yeah, I wish there was like something like, yeah, Crash Course plus Anki cards for each lesson or something. That would be amazing. Yeah. So, okay. So like, I want to come back to your YouTube talk. It's not YouTube, your TEDx talk. So yeah, as I said, you know, one thing that I've noticed very much was the struggles that you and your parents had in just getting somebody to agree to teach you. It's like, I am an enthusiastic child who wants to learn. Yeah. Go to hell. You're not bold enough. And then the second was, the end of your talk was kind of like a plea to be accepted as, you know, a normal kid who isn't being forced to do things by a tiger mom and who just enjoys learning and like, can we just actually all agree that's okay and I don't have to be demonized for that. Like, these are not your words, but I almost felt like that's what you were kind of saying. And yeah, I wanted to hear about like, what was driving that? Because I mean, it sounds like even your parents might've been getting a bit like hassled in some way, or like those assumptions that they were driving you. Oh, and like, I remember you like showed pictures of like being outside and having parties and you were kind of like, I don't just spend all my time indoors studying, man. Yeah. Yeah. So what happened? Is this some kind of like prejudice that you were like dealing with or, you know, what did you... There was definitely like the sort of prejudice that, or like the sort of assumption that, yeah, my parents are pushing me or something like this. Could you give some examples of like, yeah, stuff that happened, like that you remember and how you felt at the time? Well, I guess not just, yeah, not just even my parents, but like, you hear often, like a lot of comments are like, you know, and people are totally straight to my face, like, there's no need to hurry, you know, it's like, like as if like, this is something that I'm hurrying or anything, like, this is just me wanting to do what I want to do. And it's like, there's no need to hurry, you know, you can slow down, those sorts of comments. So there's that aspect of things. From kind of like from teachers or friends of your family or what? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a combination of, yeah, like people who I, you know, even people who I meet for the first time, sometimes they may say that, you'll see it on, yeah, sometimes teachers may say that sometimes. And of course, you know, you'll see comments, of course. Again, you know, I, of course, don't... Not that these sorts of comments I take to heart or anything, but it's just interesting to, to see these sorts of like, you know, either the comments that I get from people in person or even the comments you see online. Must have been impacting you though, like that you decided in this talk to like, make this case. I think it's, yeah, I want to clear the air, I guess, right? It's just like, certainly, yeah, I mean, it doesn't like, I'm not like saddened by it or anything like that. It doesn't like, you know, affect me in that way. I know like when people like read, sometimes people read things like YouTube comments or comments like that, and they get really affected by it. It does not like that sort of effect. It was just more like, you know, people and people are saying like, yeah, their parents must be pushing them. We're like, you know, you get like things like, you know, stereotypes about Indian parents and things like that too, right? And it's like, oh, yeah, but if casual racism, right? Yeah. Yeah. There's a bit of racism that goes in there too. And it's like, none of that is, you know, actually the reality. In fact, I think. So let's talk about the reality. So, okay. So you don't feel like you were in a hurry or you weren't being pushed to be in a hurry. So like, yeah, what was going on for you? What were you trying to get out of your life, I guess, or get out of each day or how, you know, what were your priorities or interests? I guess part of it is just like not being bored. Like, and yeah. Were you bored sometimes? Sorry? Were you bored sometimes? I mean, certainly when I was younger, like, I think definitely, you know, in the sort of elementary school and stuff like that, I was definitely bored. Yeah, that was definitely a situation. I remember like, and, you know, sometimes they'll like give me tests and stuff and I'm finishing pretty quickly. I'm just sitting at the table doing nothing. So it was like. I have a feeling like being extremely bored for long periods of time as a very young kid with absolutely no way to avoid it could be very damaging. I don't have any data to back that up, but it just feels like, I feel like I've seen it. You know, I mean, well, okay, no, that's not true. There is some data to back it up. I mean, in a sense, I don't know if you've seen the great research from Ririka Gross, who's a Australian academic and unfortunately she recently passed away, but she's one of the very few people that has done multi-decade longitudinal studies of profoundly gifted, you know, as they're called kids and kids who are left in their chronological age group at school on average are in the bottom five percentile when it comes to social outcomes. Like they do very badly. They tend to suffer depression at very high levels. They tend to have very few friends. Kids, the kids that are accelerated in by three or more grades on average are in, I can't remember exactly. I think it might be the top decile. So maybe the top 10% of exactly the same metrics. So like that, I mean, I'm sure it's not just boredom, but that certainly seems to align with the idea that leaving kids in an environment where they're bored, just to keep them around kids of the same chronological age might be a bad idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like this part of me that always wants to do something like, right. Or like wants to learn something, wants to, I guess, do research. Like actually that was another thing. Like I think that was another thing. Like when I was in community college, like it's always an aspect of me that's always looking at what's, you know, what's the goal to reach, right. You know, what is the, so I'm a very goal oriented person. So I don't know. Yeah. Like, you know, and that's a community college. Okay. What do I need to do to fast forward to a four-year college, a four-year university? And especially at that time, kind of my motivation was like, the four-year universities are like the best place to do research. And I was like, at that point, like in community college, I started getting into like, okay, like, yeah, I want to do some cutting edge research now. But like those opportunities aren't really available at community colleges. So that was my next goal. It's like, let's go to four-year universities and there'll be an opportunity for me to do research and that, and the four-year university. I'm like, okay, now let's do, I want to get to a PhD so I can do even more research. And so I'm- So you had a strong sense of where you wanted to be. You wanted to be doing cutting edge research. And there is a sequence of steps that have to be completed before you can do that. And of course, this is another thing, like, maybe this is something maybe worth touching on is like, I know there are, you know, the truth is like, the sort of, I guess, path I've taken is still kind of conventional in a way, right? Like I've still gone through like a four-year university and then a PhD, which- I was going to say, I mean, you're not like, you haven't been in a hurry at all. Like it's been 12 years from when you started college and when you were finishing your PhD, which is actually kind of slow. Yeah. So there's definitely like this sort of conventional path that I've taken. I think, I mean, that was the other thing I tell people, like, I think it also depends on the field. Like, obviously I think there's some fields where maybe a conventional path isn't necessarily the best path. So, but I think, you know, for the field that at least is sort of like, I guess I'm into this sort of biomedical engineering field. Unfortunately, it's kind of hard to do much work in that field if you don't have the sort of conventional background. And so, for us, that is also about like, you know, just working with the system and trying to, you know, try to, I guess, one person was saying like, I'm like hacking the system, like trying to accelerate in the system. So sometimes there's that aspect of things. But yeah, like, I guess, I guess also the nice thing about a conventional system is you do have those goals. And like, again, I've worked very well with having these goals. So it's like, you know, you have those goals and it's very easy to, you know, have that motivation to meet those goals. And so that's another nice aspect of, you know, the conventional system. But, you know, again, it depends per person. Like I do realize there are some people where that sort of system just doesn't work. Yeah. What is it about biomedical engineering that makes like a more conventional path necessary? I think there's, again, this sort of, so like, yeah, again, it's this sort of thing where, you know, if you want the best career opportunities, I think you have to have at least a bachelor's degree. And a lot of the times you do need a PhD. And those are the sorts of backgrounds that, of course, you, a lot of companies will require. Or if you want to get into academia, of course, that's the standard path. But then also, it is hard, I guess, depends on what kind of research you're interested in. But oftentimes the research is done in academic labs or in various companies. So, you know, you have to be involved in that system to be able to get that hands-on experience. That is a major challenge. I think if you are maybe working in like biology and more, you know, life sciences and things like that, you do have to somewhat work within that system. Whereas something like computer science and deep learning and things like that, it's definitely much easier to work outside of that system. And, you know, you can take a more unconventional path. So, yeah, I mean, there's plenty of literal high school dropouts who have gone on to very successful careers in deep learning research. Exactly. Yeah. So that is a challenge if you're in the more, yeah, more in the biomedical field. But yeah, sometimes you just have to work with that system. And yeah, I definitely, I think, and I think, like, also, it just depends on, yeah, if you still think it depends per person, right? Like, I still feel like I did get a lot out of the conventional system, which I guess maybe for some people that may be kind of interesting. But like, I still feel like I learned a lot going through the bachelor's program and then even throughout the PhD, you know, getting more experienced with research and, you know, learning how to do good research. I mean, we'll come back to this, but your PhD supervisor is not at all a conventional person. That's true. That's true. Yeah. He also has an unconventional background and the lab is definitely unconventional. But so, like, I think there's a balance of, like, you know, what opportunities are or what paths are more informational and what paths are unconventional. And, you know, some aspects may be more conventional and some may not be. And it just depends, again, per person and what works best for them. But I think I still have gotten a lot out of the experience. So it's not like anything that I regret, you know, going through this. And so for you, the, okay, so I just want to come back to this. So you did the geology and stuff at community college. And did you do some paleontology and astronomy at that community college as well? Yeah, I didn't take it. I didn't take an officially like a paleontology class. And like, there was, I think part of the geology, there's some paleontology and stuff. Did you end up with any kind of degree or diploma or something from that? Yeah. So from the community college, I obtained three associate's degrees. So those are like two-year degrees. So in what period of time? This is in 2015. Wait, you got three degrees in one year? Well, no, I mean, this still considers like, so basically from 2011 to 2014, I was, you know, that was from seven to 10. I was, you know, doing this sort of two classes per semester situation. And then from 2014, I graduated high school. And then from 2014 to 2015, I was taking like four classes per semester. And at the end of 2015, I got these three associate's degrees. Three associate's degrees. Okay. So what were those areas? The three areas? General science, math and physical sciences and foreign language studies. Okay. So then you went into the bachelor's program? Yes, I went into bachelor's in 2016. So I took another year just to finish up some prerequisites. Okay. And then did you do that bachelor's at a... Just to clarify, like, no, I think a lot of the sort of, like, the problem was like, yeah, I did community college in terms of like, when I was taking like two classes per semester, that definitely was like, you know, very slow, I think. I think that's like, it took a bit of time. And so that's why then I was like, I really need to get out of high school as soon as possible. Yeah, yeah. Because you were frustrated, right? Yeah. So I think that was another issue. Like when you say like, oh, yeah, like, oh, it's kind of slow. Like, I think that was kind of where it comes from. It's like, yeah, the two classes kind of... Absolutely. And to that rule that was like, placed on you, required you to go slow. And in hindsight, I guess you're saying you don't see any benefit from that. Yeah, yeah. So then you did the bachelor's program. So what was the bachelor's program? And where was that? Was that UC Davis? Yes, that was UC Davis. So I technically, again, I didn't have... When I joined, I technically didn't have all the pre-reqs for a biomedical engineering program. So I technically joined as biotechnology, which was like my alternate major on my application. But I really wanted to do biomedical engineering. Like, I just really wanted to do that. So I managed to like fit in like all the pre-reqs and get the schedule worked out. And I changed my major when I joined into biomedical engineering. And like, I was taking classes over the summer. I took like three classes over that summer that I was there. And I managed to graduate within two years. So like, you know, typically it's like, once you transfer, it's usually another two years. So I managed to finish up in those two years, even with some of the missing pre-reqs, because of the fact that I managed to make it up over the summer. So yeah, that's kind of how I set up. And to be clear, when you say you always wanted to do research, I mean, this is not some implanted memory, you believe now. In your TEDx talk when you were nine, this is exactly what you said. You said, I'm going to finish a PhD before I get my driver's license, which you may yet do, thanks to completely failing to get a driver's license in the normal time. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't had the need to right now, get a driver's license. So that's why you guys can probably get it. And you certainly have a need to not get it, unless you fail to meet your childhood dreams. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So two years of bachelor's and I guess the thing about homeschooling and stuff is, unless you're, I mean, maybe your parents did it differently, but at least in our case, we don't really follow a curriculum. It's kind of just like, oh, whatever comes along. Did you find that a lot of stuff in bachelor's was like just revision, or did you find a lot of it was stuff like you didn't have the necessary prerequisites to know what's going on, or what was the experience of that? Yeah. And just thinking back here, you're now like what, like 14 years old or how old are you when you're doing your bachelor's? Oh, at that time? Yeah. I was 13 years old. 13. I think once I got to my bachelor's, I think for the most part, it was mostly new content. I think there were certainly some ideas and concepts that we have encountered in the past. And so there are definitely some ideas here and there that like, yeah, I could already knew because, yeah, it's true that I definitely, I think it was a lot of the things that I Because, yeah, it's true that I definitely, I think it was also like, yeah, I think there's also the aspect of like, I've learned whatever I feel like. So like, you know, there's, so like there are some ideas here and there like, oh, I've learned this already. But like, for the most part, I think it was mostly new content. So yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think it was also like, yeah, so a lot of that content maybe is also, maybe also it's a little bit harder to actually learn, you know, just based on online resources and stuff like that. It's like, even some of these classes, they don't, some of the classes don't even like properly follow a textbook or things like that. It's more like, of course, like it's more like the professors are teaching stuff and like, and at that point, you're like also starting to get, I think, more into like, part of it is like you are getting a little bit more into cutting edge stuff and things like that. So it's, I think it's actually harder to learn, like, and this is like, again, more like, you know, junior and senior year. So these are like upper, upper, upper year, like upper class, like, yeah, these are like, you know, more specialized classes, like, again, most of the, you know, the freshman and sophomore stuff, you know, a lot of that you can easily like learn from online material. But I think once you get to some of the more specialized material, it may be harder. I don't know. Like, again, I guess maybe someone, it just depends, I think, on the, on the field and stuff like that. But I think, but yeah, I think at that point, so then again, there's like, again, there were certain ideas, like certain stuff, like if you're into research in a particular field, then you'll know a lot about that. And then of course, if the class covers it, it's like, you know, there's no point. But like, you get the, you get the sort of, I guess, broad perspective of other research fields as well, and things like that. Yeah. Which can be really helpful too, as well. So, okay, let me now switch to the social experience of being a 13 year old at Bachelors. And I will start by contrasting two cartoon versions of what that social experience might be. I suspect that the nine year old Tanish in that TEDx talk, if asked to describe what it would look like if Tanish got to go to do a Bachelors, would be like, oh my God, I'm going to be surrounded by, you know, fascinating people interested in my field. And we're going to spend all of our time talking about really interesting scientific concepts. Where else a, you know, don't be in a hurry, you know, parent of a friend might be like, oh my God, it's going to be a social nightmare for them. They're going to be the butt of jokes. They're not going to understand what's going on around them. And they'll be in the midst of adult ideas, which a young mind is not ready for. Yeah. Where on that spectrum, you know, did you find yourself? What was the experience like for you as a kid? You know? Yeah. I think for the most part, it was again, completely, I mean, it was socially, mostly it was okay. I think it was, again, interacting with, again, it's not like, I've interacted with people of this age group before, you know, through community college and things like that. I don't, I think there were, you know, sometimes there may be, you know, a little bit of friction in certain aspects of things. So for example, like, you know, sometimes, you know, students may want to work on projects, you know, for example, overnight at someone's house or apartment or whatever, dorm, whatever. And, you know, I wasn't as comfortable with that. My parents were definitely not comfortable with that. And there's also all the like stuff with like, yeah, there's also that stuff with like formals and balls and student clubs and all that, which I guess like you wouldn't really have got to participate in. I was involved in like, we have, we had like a biomedical engineering club. So I was involved in that club. And I think there was like maybe one, a couple, one or two other clubs. So I'll go to like some of the socials and stuff like that. And of course, things like going to bars and stuff like that, obviously I can't, I'm not going to participate in those sorts of things. You know, there are certain, again, that's true even now, obviously. So there are certain social activities that I cannot participate in, but like I still also have plenty of other social activities that I participate in. So it wasn't like, certainly, yeah, I don't think I wasn't like missing out too much on. You weren't feeling like, yeah, you weren't feeling like you were missing out on something important or feeling jealous? Not really. I think, yeah, I mean, certainly there are some aspects of like, yeah, I don't know. For the most part, like I managed to like make it up by like going to a lot of these social activities and, you know, even interacting during class and stuff like that. And did you get some of that like intellectually exciting engagement about your field of interest that you were hoping for? Yeah, I mean, it's socially like, I mean, again, just from a social standpoint, I don't, it's not like I'm always talking about research and things like that. I mean, of course, there's definitely that engagement I'm getting from going to classes and talking to professors and, you know, even talking to other undergraduate researchers or even some of the, you know, PhD mentors or whatever. So I do get that engagement. But then also a lot of the engagement, the sort of socialization and engagement that I have with other students at the same time was just regular, I guess, socialization, I guess. I don't know. There's nothing like it's not, I'm not always talking about, I guess, you know, biomedical engineering. There's, you know, I'm talking about other things too. So, you know. Well, you and I always talk about deep learning. It's that. That's always true. That's always true. They're like during the meetings, especially at the beginning, you talk about, you know, what you're up to. We talk about what we're up to and things. I guess that's always true. I'm very happy talking about deep learning though. So that's probably my fault. I mean, I like talking about all this research and stuff too, but like, yeah, I mean, I just, I just try to balance everything, I guess. Just to get everything balanced. But it sounds like overall that, that, that experience was closer to what a starry eyed nine-year-old Tunisian was hoping for than, than what a, you know, a conservative parent might've been worried about. I think so. Yeah. I think so. I think, I think there was more, I think it was more like, yeah, I think it was more like things like in terms of like what was maybe more stressful or more concerning was actually more like actual work, like things like just the workload. Cause you know, I'm taking like, again, four classes. And again, most of, most of the sort of work is actually not the learning. It's more of actually doing homework and, you know, essays and projects and stuff like that. And, you know, that's not, a lot of it is not actually learning the concepts. It's just like actually doing that work. And so, yeah. It's a lot of time. Yeah. It takes time. There's a lot of workloads that can sometimes be a little bit stressful. And then there's certainly, again, there were some, you know, like I mentioned, some, sometimes there will be friction between, you know, with certain people. So, you know, it's about sometimes managing those social dynamics. So there's certainly more, I think there was definitely some social dynamics that I had to manage when I was in Bafflers. But for the most part, you know, I think it was a valuable and interesting and engaging experience as a whole. But yeah. Are there like, you know, in terms of both the being at the Bachelors and the process to getting there, in hindsight, are there now, you know, regrets or things you wish you had done differently? Or do you feel overall like the path you took is, you know, feels like the right one in hindsight? I can't think of anything. Yeah. Nothing comes immediately to mind in terms of like regrets or anything like that. I think for the most part, I think in terms of the Bachelors program, yeah, I think it did what I wanted to do. I think, okay, so maybe like one thing was potentially, so at the time it seemed like a regret, but now I don't think it like, so like, I think a lot of it was like, you know, being a researcher, even actually during my Bachelors, I unfortunately didn't get to spend as much time working on research as I wanted to. Because there was a lot of classwork and especially, you know, yeah, especially in these last two years, in a typical Bachelors program, these last two years are especially busy in terms of like, for example, the final year we have like a CR design project, which is basically like, we have to design a device and build it and supposed to meet clinical needs and all this sort of, it's a whole process, it's a year long process. And that's like the requirement, and it takes a lot of time. So there's a lot of things that like took a lot of time and didn't, so I didn't get much opportunity to do research. And so, you know, things like, oh, maybe I don't have any, many papers when I graduate or anything like that, like sometimes, and you know, it can be hard to like, you know, compete for things like fellowships and stuff like that when it comes to that. And eventually, like I was originally working in synthetic biology and in the lab that was interested, I was working in, and I wanted to continue in that lab, but then, yeah, I think the professor was also maybe a little bit concerned about certain things and wasn't willing to have me on. Based on your youth or based on? No, I think more based on the sort of research output, right? I don't know. I think maybe, like, sort of. Because you were so busy with all the work you had to do for your Bachelors. So I was like, I think he was like, yeah, so I think. That must have been disappointing. Oh, I shouldn't have spent so much time on classes and stuff like that. Like, that was like my thing, like, oh, why did I spend so much time? I should have spent more time on research. But in hindsight, that allowed me to pivot more directly towards deep learning. So in hindsight, like, I think it was kind of good that I actually, you know, was maybe did it. Yeah, that didn't work out and allowed me to pivot into this new field where I feel like it's, you know, it's very promising and something that I really enjoy. And the other thing was like a few, like, synthetic biology was like, maybe more on. Maybe it could be more exhausting because it's like the sort of that's the sort of research where you do have to spend like an eight to six or eight to even like something like, you know, I spent like 12 hours in the lab every day, you know, doing stuff. And also like, it seems from the outside, like, SynthBio is exciting, but also still pretty speculative as far as I can tell, whereas deep learning is really changing the world right now. I mean, I'm still pretty excited about the field, but like, I can, but, and, you know, so I'm only still. I don't mean by speculative. I'm not saying it's not going to turn out, but like, it's like time spent working on AI in medicine is very likely to have a significant impact on society, whereas SynthBio feels like, I don't know, kind of feels like working on quantum computing or something. I mean, I still think SynthBio is probably more like further along in quantum computing, but yeah, I see what you mean. Yeah. But so I think in the end it turned out for the best, but I think at the time that was definitely kind of like, I had, I think I maybe had a little bit of that concern. I was like, oh, did I, did I do the best thing here? And the other thing is like, yeah, like things like competing for fellowships and stuff, because, you know, you see you're competing with, that was another major challenge is you're competing with all these students who have gone through the whole process, right? They, they, they got through high school. Maybe they've even done some, sometimes they do research opportunities in high school. So they have some research opportunities there. Then they've done the typical bachelor's program. So they've done the four years and usually they join a lab by the end of like their first year. And so they have three years of doing research. And so at the end of their bachelor's program, they've probably had already at least one first author paper. And so when you compare on paper, my resume to these other folks, a lot of times they will select, you know, those other folks because they already have all these papers in this sort of experience. Whereas I don't, of course that, I mean, I'm in a whole different situation in terms of my background and I guess my potential as well, but that's not what they're looking at. So there's also that issue as well, which for a long time, you know, I didn't have any fellowships. It was hard. I did have a fellowship, an internal fellowship from UC Davis, but I wasn't able to get any external, I couldn't get any external fellowships for, for this reason. So there was sort of that issue as well, where I was like, oh, maybe this was, this is a bit of a challenge and it's hard to compare, I guess, for these folks to compare. But I mean, it must've felt, it must've felt like a bit of a serious kick in the guts at the time. Like it must've been a real disappointment. Yes, it certainly did. I think, you know, at that time I was like, certainly like thinking about what I was going to do. And, you know, I was like, yeah, in terms of like getting fellowships, in terms of finding a lab, all these sorts of things, this was at the beginning of my PhD basically. And it was certainly a major, major challenge. And having said that, it's not like, it's not the kind of disappointment that is unknown for children to deal with. Like kids in sport deal with that all the time, right? They're like, didn't get into the first team or whatever. And it's, it's, it's not necessarily a bad thing to have some experience of. And at the time it was not like a new experience either. It's not like, like it just overall, like I haven't, you'd be surprised, like I haven't gotten many scholarships or anything like that. People think, oh, you must have easily gotten like tons of scholarships and stuff like that. But surprisingly, I have not been able to, you know, get those sorts of opportunities. Luckily for, you know, undergrad, I did manage to get one scholarship that definitely helped and things like that. But like, you know, it's not like, I've, you know, I've heard definitely from a lot of people like, oh wow, you must have like gotten like tons of scholarships based on your achievements. Like, that's not this actually the scenario. I've been rejected from lots of different scholarships, lots of different opportunities. So it was not, even at that time, it wasn't something that was new to me. It was, so it was certainly a saddening experience. I think each time you get rejected, it still kind of stings a bit. It's not like, oh, I don't care about that. But, you know, and eventually I think it all worked out for the best. And I think that's what, what matters at the end. So, you know, you just kind of have to, even when you get rejections, you have to keep your hopes up that it eventually works out because it tends to eventually work out. So that was, you know, I've been lucky that that's what happened. So before we talk about like the PhD more, I'd love to just go back over some things that I was curious about during those earlier years. One is the time you went on the Conan O'Brien show. So for those who don't remember, Conan was huge, you know, he was the big late night show guy. And you were his guest. So yeah, how did that happen? Yeah, so actually I was on this show, Child Genius, which was this kind of competition for so many different child prodigies. And so I was there to actually promote that show. That's kind of what, you know, that's why I was invited there. And so, yeah, that's kind of, it just came through that. And so, yeah, they were trying to get some of the contestants to go on various late night shows and I guess, or just various shows, I guess, like I think, yeah, there's like Conan and like, I think one of the late late show and like, I think Ellen and things like that. So they had some of the kids go on different shows. So I got to go on Conan. Yeah. And so we have Child Genius here in Australia. I wonder if it's the same thing. It's kind of like a kind of a quiz show where they do like STEM things and memory things and whatever. Pretty much. Yeah, I think it's probably the same show. It was originally a British show. That's the original show was from Britain. And then they wanted to do it also in the US. So I think they did two seasons of the show. I was in the first season. Yeah, we did two or three here as well. And weirdly enough, the guy who won the first, like I kind of live in the middle of nowhere a bit, but funnily enough, the guy who won the first series in Australia lives like, I don't know, five or 10 minute drive from our house. It's really random. So do you know that person? I don't. I always feel like I should reach out, but I don't know if it's like lame or not. Yeah. It's funny that people now kind of recognize me from these appearances. And it's something just, I mean, it can be kind of nice to be like, oh, it's like just kind of an additional connection. I mean, there are people who are in the ML community and they're like, oh, I've never seen you on the show. It's cool to see you here now. It's like. How did you go on the show? I think you probably know, like, I think it was like a Bojan on Twitter, I think, or he's like the Kaggle Grandmaster. It was like, you know, he's that SG boost guy, as I like to say. Anyway, I remember once he tweeted me, he's like, oh, yeah, I remember watching this show, you know, a while back and, you know, we were rooting for you and things like that. And it's like kind of funny to see. And I think he also was kind of interested. And then there's like, I think someone, yeah, I'm one of like one of the collaborators I'm working with right now. Also, he was like, when I met him, I think at like, I think it was at one of the, I think it was at ICML in the virtual conference or something. And he like almost immediately recognized me. It was kind of, so it's kind of funny to have people recognize me. And how did you go in the show? Oh, he didn't. I was like, so there was like eight rounds. I got eliminated after the fifth round, unfortunately. Oh, not bad. By one point or something, it got eliminated. Not bad. But yeah, it was, you know, yeah, still sometimes kick myself about that. But like, you know, it's all good. At least in the one they had here, a lot of it seemed to be about memory and it seemed like knowing some basic kind of mnemonic memory palace kind of techniques would have got you a long way. Did you, was that the same for yours? Yeah, but it was, I think, I think, yeah, it was definitely, it was still like the sheer amount of stuff that you needed to have memorized. It was definitely a little bit difficult, especially the other issue was like, at that time, again, I was like, I think I was still taking like, again, like maybe two, it happened during the summer, but at the same time, I was still taking like two summer classes. And, you know, these are like eight week classes that go by very quickly. So I'm like trying to keep up with both my summer classes as well as, you know, this quiz show. So I think that definitely got a little bit tough. I mean, you know, I, you know, the other contestants definitely did not have anything like that to worry about. So there was definitely that very, you know, I, of course, I felt like, you know, my, my college classes definitely had a higher priority. But I think, so I think that was like maybe one of the reasons why it was, I struggled a bit, you know, just because like, you know, it was like a week, it was basically weekly. So like, after you do, it's like, it's like, or like every one or two weeks, it's like one week of one subject, then you get the material for the next subject and you've got to like, you know, this is like, okay, this is what the kind of material for the next subject. So you got to study that. So it's like every week it's got to study. And then of course I had my classes and then sometimes they'll come to your house and film, you know, cause they want to have. Oh right, yeah, they do all the backgrounders, whatever. It was, it was a very chaotic. So yeah, in spite of all that, you know, I guess, you know, I managed to semi well, I mean, there were, I mean, still some of the memory stuff, I, I'm still kind of like amazed that I could do some of that stuff still. Did you learn like explicitly at some point, some of those kind of memory palace techniques or kind of, you know, number lists techniques? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So like, I mean, actually. Did they teach you that or that was something you would already know? Yeah, I never actually learned anything like that in the past. And then it was, it was, yeah, so I never actually did any memory palace stuff in the past. I think maybe something that probably should explore even more, even further now. A lot of it, I do tend to just do road memorization and it seems to work very, seems to work fine for me overall. Like I'd memorize speeches that, you know, like 20, 20 minute speeches and I can memorize them in like two hours, just road memorization. And I just managed to do that. Like, you know, so I've never had an issue with that kind of thing, but there were some parts where like, so there was like one part was like a deck of cards and memorizing a deck of cards. That one was a little bit harder to do road memorization. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So, so I mean, the day before, the day before the actual competition or the actual quiz, we decided to change strategy and I studied how the memory palace method worked. And this was like, yeah, one or two days. Yeah, I mean, there's no way you can do that without harmonic techniques. So yeah, this was like one or two days before the actual quiz. And, you know, of course that's not including the time going into fly and all the hot temper and all that. So this is one or two days before, like, yeah, about a day before. And I just studied the memory palace technique. We came up with this sort of memory palace and I was trying to play around with it. And I'm like starting to get like, you know, 49, 50 of the cards now correct. And I was like starting to, you know, I said, now I was like, okay, I feel pretty confident about this before, you know, I was not, I was only getting like maybe half of the cards and like I was really struggling. And with the memory palace, it really seemed to work. And it turns out for the actual competition, I did the actual quiz and did the actual memorization. I think we were given like an hour to memorize it or something like that. I think it was about an hour. Yeah, I think it was an hour and I managed to get all 52 correct. Nice. Well, some people might not be familiar with this. So can you explain how, what a memory palace technique is, or maybe specifically what technique you use to memorize the whole deck of cards? Because a lot of people would be, if they aren't familiar with the technique, will be like, oh, okay, this guy's a total genius. But actually anybody can do this, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the way I had it set up was like, so you have like, you know, if it's like an ace of spades, you know, like an ace of, yeah, ace of spades or something like that, you know, basically like you have, you assign it, you know, like an ace, you assign to some sort of, you assign different characteristics. So like ace could be like, for example, maybe a person, somebody you know, or something like this. I think that's how I had it set up. Like the ace was a person and spades would be like maybe something related to spades. So I don't know, like, you know, some novel or something like this, you know, something related. So, so the end of the person like is also probably related. So like if it's an eighth, maybe it'd be something, maybe a person whose name starts with an A or something like that. Yeah. And then what you do is that, you know, you have like in this case, 52 cards in a deck. So the way I had it set up was like, you know, you have 52 locations in say your house and then, you know, they're in some sort of order. And then you kind of, you kind of imagine that at each location, you put this sort of card. So by putting the card, you're thinking of whatever object or person or whatever you have with whatever action, you know, based on, you know, ace of spades, or it's like some person with the spade or something like something, some sort of action in the person. And then you put them at that sort of location in your palace, your memory palace. In your imagination. Exactly. Your imagination palace, which I had is just my house. And then you have these different locations. And then when you're remembering it, you can kind of just walk along that path. And, you know, you kind of just visually are walking along that path and like, okay, you're at, you know, for example, you're at the garage. Okay. Now in the garage, we're supposed to be there. You know, you've already placed that person. It comes much easier because you, you know, you have like a person, you have an action. It's more like tangible. It's much easier to memorize and say ace of spades. But it's much more easier to. And there's also segues from one to the next. Exactly. And it'd be kind of like, maybe sometimes some people try to like, maybe come up with like a story or something like that to just kind of, you know, further, you know, cement that sort of, you know, that pattern. Did you ever read the book, Moonwalking with Einstein? I have not. It's great. Yeah. So I don't know if you've heard of Ed Koch. Ed Koch was like the greatest memory, world memory champion of all time. Like one, I can't remember five or six world championships or something. And basically he, he worked with a guy called Joshua Fore, who was a journalist slash author, who considered himself to have a very bad memory and bought Josh for these memory techniques over a one year period. And then Josh Fore entered the US National Memory Championships to see how he went, you know, and it's a, quite a delightful book actually. And I've actually met Josh. He's a really super guy. He went on to found Atlas Obscura, you know, that fantastic. I think, yeah, I think that website, like, okay, interesting kind of backroids about location. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, his, his, his point was basically, yeah. And anybody can do this to an extremely high level if you just learn how, and I've spent a significant chunk of time learning that as well. The more, you know, there are like, it's also useful for learning about your own psychology because you learn about how brains remember things that are like funny, ridiculous, violent, related to celebrities, related to family members, whatever. So you kind of come up with a story with the properties of things that our brains are good at remembering. Yeah. Yeah. Some of my house is written down the exact thing. I have to find it. Like there's a, I have a paper of like the exact, yeah, what I was assigned, you know, for the different cards. And then the other thing is like, I was kind of surprised, like, even with memory palace, how long you can remember it. I think like maybe like a year or so, I was still able to remember it, which is like, kind of surprising, like, you know. And if you then follow a spaced memory technique for, yeah, if you didn't follow a spaced memory technique for revising it, you will literally know. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I didn't really care if I remembered that forever. Yeah. I guess there's something important. You definitely could do that. And, you know, yeah. So I don't know. That was kind of interesting. So. Actually, talking of which, do you used, you know, spaced repetition at all or have you? I mean, I think I dabbled in it for a bit. But, you know, I think it's just like something like, there's a, so like for me, yeah, I think I definitely still want to investigate it, I guess. It's like, I think there's a lot of this like, this sort of system and also like, it's definitely something that it's like something I definitely need to get started with. And I still haven't, you know, done it. I think I've, you know, I've definitely dabbled with it. Like, I think I maybe made a few cards. Like an Anki or something? Like, I think there was like an Anki Droid app or something like that. Yeah, there is an Anki Droid app. That, and I was like playing around with it. So let me just quickly explain to people who might not be familiar with this. This is just like a really simple idea that came out of a 19th century research by a guy called Ebbinghaus. It basically says, if you try to remember something that you previously learned after one day and then after three days and then after a week and then after three weeks, and then after a couple of months, you know, this kind of exponentially, increasingly timescale. Yeah, you remember it forever with, you know, super linearly decreasing amounts of effort. So yeah, I actually would love to encourage you to try it because my daughter does it, you know, and it's so cool teaching her and her friend math and knowing they do their Anki cards each day. So I know everything I've ever taught them. They definitely remember all of it because if they didn't, you know, then their Anki would be revising it at the right time. And my wife's, yeah. This Anki stuff is like, at a certain point, like doesn't your deck become unnaturally large and like very difficult to deal with? No, not if you manage it carefully because you have exponentially increasing time distances between each one. It's yeah, that doesn't happen. So I learned Chinese. I learned Chinese. I have a bad memory, I would say. I don't know. Everybody's memory is pretty similar, statistically speaking, but I think mine may be a slightly worse than usual, but I learned 6,000 Chinese characters faster than anybody at the Chinese university had ever heard of, basically by doing Anki and not just Anki, but also using a fairly sophisticated mnemonic methodology that had been developed at the university of Hawaii. And yeah, I still remember those characters. And one of the things I really like about it, Tanishq, is that it forces you to like get serious about recognizing your both capabilities and limitations, which is to say, if your Anki deck is too much, then you are trying to learn more things than you can remember. So then you have to make a choice like, okay, you're doing things optimally, it's too big. So you now have to decide what things do you want to learn? So then you kind of don't end up studying so much that you can't remember it. So I like that about it. You know, and yeah, my wife's studying for a master's at the moment. She's already got a PhD, so she's keeping busy and she's using Anki for the first time and she's just like, oh my God, I don't have to study for exams anymore. You know, she gets 100% because she knows she knows it all. I know like, like, medical students commonly use Anki for that reason. I don't know how successful it is. I assume it's pretty successful if everyone's doing it, but. Yeah, I don't know why it's so popular in medicine, but almost nothing else. But I feel like for Claire, you know, when she does that for the next 12 years, everything she's, it's not everything that she's learned to remember, everything that she's learned that she wants to remember, to remember. So I always say to her, don't add a card until like, unless you want to remember it forever or your teacher tells you this is something you do need to know. So anyway, sorry for the slight diversion. Is there like a benefit? Like, I know, like, for example, medical school students, they like tend to like download Anki decks online and things like that. And I guess my like thing was like, yeah, that's a bad idea. Yeah. Like, what is it like? Because I've talked to other people and they're like, well, you know, it's maybe, you know, like you're still memorizing it and still remaining in memory. So like, I guess that's another thing of like writing it down yourself versus using other people's Anki decks is also. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, do it yourself. So actually there's a guy called Peter Wozniak who rediscovered the work of Ebbinghaus independently and has dedicated his life to, you know, practicing it and studying it. And he's got a great website called supermemo.guru. And he's got 20 tips for like actually learning stuff. And one of the key tips is like, yeah, like create your own cards and like they need context, you know, so like for my Chinese, I listened to a lot of podcasts in Chinese and every character I learned that, you know, I would have the sentence where I first learned about it as part of the card. For Claire's cards, I, you know, there's always a drawing or a snapshot from a YouTube video or something of like, this is where you learnt this. And the, you've got the context, you've got the reason to remember it. You've got the, that sense of like, oh, this is what I was doing at the time. You know, all the stuff that helps your brain. Yeah. If you download Anki cards, you miss all that. It's. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's definitely this, you know, this sort of thing like, well, like I think also like, I know like, I think like Radek made a whole Anki card sort of situation for, you know, vast AI course. She, he had like a quiz website and all. Aiquizs.com or something. Yeah. Yeah. And I was doing it and I think I was getting emails and then I think I was doing it. I don't know. But then I think like the email stopped or something. So I don't know if I messed up something or if it just like stopped sending emails. So I think this is a good reminder for me to go back and check that as well, because that obviously the AI stuff is stuff that I definitely want to, you know, make sure. Well, the only thing I'll say though, is if you're using the Anki, you remember it. Like I never use Anki or anything for like any programming topic or whatever. I just, I just code. Because I hear like a lot of times, sometimes, yeah, programmers use it, for example, to memorize APIs and things like that. So as you were saying, you mentioned that because it seems like that's another common application, I think, like people, like sometimes there are programmers who do that. So yeah, I'm curious why, I guess you just never, I guess as you're using it, like, do you ever feel like you're maybe, yeah, there may be certain APIs or suddenly commands and stuff that you may feel like you're missing? Yeah, I've just never found that. Yeah, because I'm using it. Anyway, so after that, sorry, I hadn't quite realized you're on file genius and it's the same show and that's super interesting to me, but I want to, yeah, so coming back to, okay, so you're on Conan. Now, I don't know if I'm being ridiculous or oversensitive or whatever, but my reaction to seeing you on Conan was, I felt pretty mad, actually. I felt annoyed at him because it's not that he said anything rude to you, but I definitely felt like he was, like, I don't know what, I don't know what you say in America, in Australia, you'd say taking the piss, you know, he was like basically imply, you know, laughing at the fact that you're interested in physics or laughing at the fact that you want to get a PhD. Yeah, I mean, did you feel that or did you feel it's all good or looking back, do you feel differently to how he felt then? I think you may be like the first person who's ever said anything like that before. So honestly, I'm kind of surprised that you think that way. I don't know. I mean, if you didn't feel that way, then that's good. I had a very positive experience on the show. I mean, he seemed like he's really nice to you backstage and whatnot, right? Yeah. Well, I didn't, the thing was like, you know, we knew it was a comedy show and, you know, part of it is we are kind of, we've kind of been on the joke too, right? Like, I think, like, you know, I definitely realized that, you know, me, I guess, yeah, when some of the examples were like, you know, me wishing for enzymes for Christmas lists or, you know, a calculator or textbooks and things like that. And, you know, it's like, even I said, even at that age, I realized that that is, you know, abnormal. And like, it's not like those were things like, like we, it was also things like we brought up, like, you know, this was like, yeah, this is something we could talk about. It's kind of funny. It's like, and like, you know, you know, I realized that, like, you know, this is, this is different. I think it's more like, you know, it's not, it was not laughing at me as, you know, it's more like, oh, it's different. It's kind of interesting kind of thing. You know, it's not, that's kind of what it was like, oh, it's kind of funny that it's interesting, like, you know, this kid like wants enzyme, like, even like, you know, I know, like I really want it, but I realized, you know, people find that kind of odd. And, you know, I didn't have any, I didn't take an issue with it. That's great. I mean, now I feel kind of lame for taking issue with it because I definitely felt like it. I mean, you know, Conan himself was like, he's a very smart guy too. He went to Harvard and he's not like, so he, you know, I don't think, I think, you know, it's just a joke for all of us. I think it was not, it was not, you know, they're not. That's cool. That's great. You know, that they don't have an ill will against me or anything like that. So. Oh no, I mean, of course not. I just, yeah, it was just joke, I don't know, joking about the fact that you're an intelligent person who has bold dreams. I don't know, like if some kid went on who had just won the under 1700 meters track and field when they were 11, I don't feel like that would, they would be laughing about, you know, if they said like, what do you want to be when you grow up? And he'd be like a professional athlete. They'd be like, I don't know. It just feels. I don't know if they were necessarily laughing about that. I think they were just more laughing about like, yeah, you know, kind of funny that, you know, I want to, or like, and then I, of course I was telling jokes too. And I was kind of. Absolutely. Love your jokes. So, um, I don't know. I felt like, like I thought the chemistry between me and Conan and the other guests work was really good. And I kind of felt like I was also in my element at the time. So I don't know. I felt like, personally, I thought it was a, it was a, you know, a fairly good interview altogether. I mean, obviously it must've been given that nobody else has complained about this kid before and you didn't feel the same way. So absolutely. It's, uh, yeah, that's why I prefaced this by saying I might be totally, I don't know. I think, you know, I think it was like, you know, Conan is, I think known for his kind of self-deprecating humor. And I think it was just kind of, you know, kind of along that sort of line of, you know. Yeah. Oh, I mean, I love Conan to be clear. I watched him nightly for years. Yeah. Yeah. I have no problem with the guy. I think he's great. And it was good that also like, you know, he, we met him before, before the interview and, you know, stuff like that. It's just to, you know, make me feel more comfortable. Yeah. Yeah. I can keep in like, if I did get to meet him and stuff, you know, maybe I could see myself, maybe feeling a little bit, maybe weirded out by that or something like that. I don't know. And then, I mean, they really liked me on the show. And like, I think later on, they wanted me to do like one of their web exclusives or something like this with like, like Professor Brian Cox or something like this. So they had me for another thing like that. Oh, I never saw that. That's interesting. Yeah. It's like on, it's on like the Tide Coco website. So I don't think many people have seen it actually, but like I did one, I, so I came back later. Yeah. So I actually came back for another episode where Brian Cox was a guest and after his interviews, I got to watch the interview and, you know, kind of be part of their, you know, you know, part of the backstage and all. And then after, afterwards, when Brian Cox was done, then they, yeah, I got to interview him and, you know, just also had another good time. That's awesome. We love Brian Cox. Yeah. So that was another event and like, yeah. So yeah, I really, yeah, it was, I really had a lot of fun actually with, you know, both of those Conan, Conan sessions. I was like, yeah, that's like, one of the coolest things I felt like I've done. So yeah, of course, you know, I've done a lot of cool things. You know, I've had the, you know, I'm very grateful and lucky, but I think this is also one of the cool things that I got to do. Well, let's, yeah. I mean, so tell me more, what, what are other like memorable moments in your life or like just things that you look back on and feel a lot of joy or pride or whatever? Yeah. Or I'm certainly like, even now is like, I think now I kind of feel like maybe I'm in that stage where like, wow, this is like, you know, part of this sort of AI revolution and being kind of, you know, at the forefront of that, you know, working at this company that is all obviously, you know, taking leading charge on that and, you know, working with lots of respectable names in the field. And yeah, like, like something like, yeah, what we're doing. Yeah. I just feel like what we're doing right now is, yeah, it's going to change the world, right? Or it is changing the world. I feel the same way. Yeah. And so I'm very proud of that. And I want that to continue as much as possible. And so I'm just kind of like trying to enjoy the ride as well. So that certainly like that comes to mind, like, you know, for example, the Stability AI launch party, I was in attendance for that. And it's like, you could see like, you know, these are like the biggest names in the field, like in the tech industry overall, not just in AI. Like, you know, I don't know if you heard like Sergey Brin was there. I did. Like, it was like, you know, the biggest name in the field and they're all there to, to witness this. And it's like, I'm lucky to be part of that team. You know, that's kind of, you know, this might be going in the history books. We never know. I mean, absolutely. And not just part of the team, but a leader in that team. Yeah. That's why I'm really excited to be in that space. And I think those memories are being made right now. Yeah. Let's see, what else? I mean, it was cool that like, you know, you, you invited to one of our regular chats, the guy who basically built the technology that, that stable, the fusion, that stability AI is based on. And we got to hear from him directly how it came to pass. And it's pretty amazing. It's like, yeah, cause yeah, I know him now through stability and it's kind of interesting to, to interact with, you know, someone who's clearly the leader in the field and, and learn from them. Like, that's the biggest thing is like, I was trying to. And this is what you really always wanted, right? Like that you were talking about as a kid is, is wanting to do research with top researchers. Exactly. Yeah. This is definitely, definitely the dream. And yeah. So that's an awesome answer. What about, yeah, going back a bit, other memorable moments? Like I was going to say, like the TEDx talk was definitely a memorable moment. I think, yeah, there's a lot of preparation that went to that actually, you know, it was like actually a few months of preparation. So that was actually quite memorable. Your delivery was excellent. You know, I practiced it several times, you know, they gave some, some help as well. And I think they came out well. It did. Yeah. Let's see. What else? I think it was like, I think a lot of the, you know, somewhat, some of the international trips were also very exciting too. Yeah. I was reading about a trip you took to India to VJTI, where your mom was saying that one of your ancestors had been like director of this institute or something. Is that, is that one of those memorable trips for you? Yeah. The Dean of the college or something like that. Yeah. So yeah, I was invited to speak at one of their, I think it was like some tech event, you know, like, so it was like. So what is VJTI? Oh yeah. VJTI is like one of the, again, leading universities, the tech universities in India. So, you know, India does have a lot of good IT and focused universities in general. So VJTI is one of those universities. And so they have like the sort of, I think it was like Technobanza or something. It's a fairly big event, multi-day event. And, you know, they have, you know, they have lots of different things going on, competitions, talks, all kinds of different, you know, tech related stuff. So they had invited me to give like, I think it was like kind of like one of their keynote talks or like one of their, they have a talk series and, you know, there's a lot of esteemed guests that have given talks in the past through this talk series. And I mean, it must have been pretty special for your mom too, since her uncle was the director of the place to be back. Yeah. So yeah, he wasn't, he's not anymore, but he was in the past. And I think my mom, you know, had come to the university in the past and, you know, had made some visits in the past when he was there. And so actually afterwards, after the talk, we actually, you know, they have the living quarters for the dean over there. And we actually made a visit and my mom was actually a little bit nostalgic about like, yeah, because she actually had come there before. Yeah, she went there before and it was hanging around. She had, you know, she had made a few visits. So she was actually a little bit nostalgic about that. And, you know, definitely, yeah, definitely proud of that. Then, you know, you know, several years later, I guess a couple of decades later, you know, I'm there to speak. But for me, I think what was really great about that trip was, so, you know, there's a lot of students and also there was a lot of like high school students as well. So like a lot of high school students came and it was like, I think they had some competitions and stuff like that. And then they had me like give the awards to all the students actually. Wow. And they also ended up even afterwards that a lot of the students came up to me and they were, you know, they wanted to take pictures of me and they wanted to, they came like hot over to us. And it was like, it was like kind of like, I think like that's like, I'm very glad to know that I've inspired a lot of students around the world. I think that definitely a huge impact. Not so like, like that's another thing like about like, I think we'd be talking about this earlier in terms of like what I'm doing as a researcher, but then also my journey as a child prodigy and like balancing that out in terms of like who I am as, you know, it's my identity. Right. I think, I think, you know, inspiring all these students, you know, through my journey is something that I'm definitely very proud of. And so I definitely, yeah, I take a lot of pride in that. And so that's why like, I don't also want to, I don't want to minimize that, obviously. Yeah. But so the balance you're talking about there is like at one level, you know, you were lauded, recognized as a child genius, child prodigy. And that is something which can provide a role model, direction, inspiration for other kids, but at another level, you know, now you're, you're not a kid, you're an adult and you, I guess, would want to be recognized for your current achievements rather than your, that, you know, your interesting past. Is that, is that the compromise you're referring to? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of what I'm talking about. Yeah. And so, you know, these sorts of events where like, you know, I get to talk to some of these people, all these students, you know, kind of face to face reminds me of, you know, that, you know, my, my journey has had a huge impact on others. And, you know, there's so many moments like that, like, yeah, I think a couple, I think it was like last year or so, or maybe, yeah, a couple of years ago, there was some news about, you know, there's a student who also was trying to accelerate in her academic path in India. And the judge actually cited, I think my TEDx talk, you know, and used that as, you know, a kind of a, as evidence or like kind of as, you know, just for, in support of the student. So, you know, even kind of, I guess, even in the courts, they are using my case to help other students. And that's obviously something that's... Well, as are we, I mean, in my family, you know, I've watched your TEDx talk with my daughter. It's like perfect timing for her because she's at the age that you're referring to in the talk, even though you were two years older. And we've also watched Child Genius Australia together, which is generally around about kids of eight or nine, but, you know, in the general ballpark. Yeah, I think she, you know, she liked seeing people that doing things that seemed exciting and not totally out of reach and being respected and appreciated for that. Absolutely. I think it does. I think it's made a difference for our family. Yeah. That's really good to hear. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it definitely means a lot to me when I hear that from people. So, it was good to see that both in person, you know, I was there at the VGTI and then also in the same trip, we also went to like a high school. And, you know, I think, yeah, they invited me in to give a talk and also my sister to sing there. And then a lot of the students, you know, were very happy. And they asked us a bunch of questions. They were very engaged. And, yeah, it was good to see that, you know, it certainly, I guess, lighted up their day and inspired them. And then I still get messages occasionally on Twitter or Facebook, whatever. And, you know, that's also always great to see. And also, I mean, I imagine your trip to NASA must have some special memories. Yeah. Is that chronologically? I'm not quite sure how that is. My trip to NASA, I must have been like nine years old or so. So, yeah. Yeah, it says here you were nine, July 2012. Yeah. So, like, that was also like a very interesting trip because I was like starting to maybe download a little bit of research. So, that's kind of when I like started first dabbling in bit of research. So, that was like me talking about, I think it was like something about like citizen science tools and how it can be used. There's something like, it was like moon topography and stuff like that. And there's like a different citizen science tools. And I was like comparing them and talking about that. So, yeah, I was doing something like that because, yeah, at that time, of course, citizen science tools were kind of like one of the few ways I could get involved. So, I was really excited to play around with such tools. And, you know. How did you get that? How did you get that opportunity? Because at least according to what I'm reading, it says you are the youngest person to speak at a NASA conference. I mean, I've been to a few NASA events in the past, and I think we were able to reach out to some of the folks there and they were very willing to support me and support my interests. So, luckily through that, you know, through some of the folks there. So, this is, by the way, this is at NASA Ames. So, this is in. Oh, cool. Yeah, I taught there for a while. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Was that through like Singularity University? Yeah. Yeah. Through SU. Yeah. It's a fascinating campus with that giant airship thing in the middle. Yeah. I remember like back then. So, like, I know there was like, I think they were like, you know, dismantling it. I think there's like asbestos problems or something like that. Yeah, that's exactly right. They dismantled it. And actually, they let, if I remember correctly, Sergey and Larry use the airstrip there, kind of in exchange for them helping to fund that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was lucky to be there before it was torn down. Well, as I was going, like, you know, I think maybe some of the first events were like, maybe in 2010, 2011. And then I started going for, you know, for a few years. So, like, I was like, watching, you know, seeing it getting dismantled over, you know, months and months. And you just see it like slowly getting dismantled. So, it was kind of interesting to kind of see that. But yeah, so I've made a few contacts at NASA Ames that way. Yeah. Cool. Head of the, I guess, the Lunar Science Institute or whatever that they had there. And they were really... I gotta say, for me, it was quite an inspiring place to be around. Like, there's always interesting things happening. And yeah, like, you know, they have this, they had this amazing visualization kind of wall. They had quantum computing happening there. And of course, the place is kind of dotted with relics of the space here around the place. Yeah. I mean, for me as an adult, it was bloody exciting. But I guess for a nine-year-old, it must have been even more amazing. Yeah, definitely very exciting. And yeah, I think that was probably maybe, that may have been like my first conference. Now that I think about it, I think that may have been like my first scientific conference that I attended. But it was still like mostly like, you know, high school students and stuff, but they're like presenting research and stuff. So, it was still kind of like a, you know, it was like a symposium. So, like, you know, research related. And so, I was, you know, I think that was like a really great event for me to kind of like soak that all in. And also at that age, my understanding, talking of astronomy, you started a, or co-founded an astronomy club at your college. Yeah. So, I guess like, yeah, I was taking astronomy class there. And then, you know, there's a lot of big club opportunities, you know, at community colleges. And so, yeah, I think maybe we talked about like, you know, clubs and stuff like that. So, like, even in community colleges, there are a lot of great clubs in terms of like, yeah, geology, biology, all these different clubs. Yeah. And so, even then, I was like wanting to get involved in those sorts of opportunities. But it turned out for like the astronomy department, they didn't actually have any sort of student run club or anything like that. So, you know, I just, you know, brought that up to my professor and said like, this is something maybe we could have over here. And yeah, he was also on board and, you know, interested in helping out because you have to have like one faculty member kind of sign off on your application or whatever. And then we kind of were starting to recruit folks. And so, we had some folks who are interested and we formed a small little club. And then it kind of grew into also a physics club. I think they didn't also have a physics club at the time. So, we need like a physics and astronomy club. But so, I was like the founding vice president. So, I was the vice president for like two, maybe two years, I think, two or three years, something like that. And we kind of started a couple of projects. I wasn't unfortunately able to see those projects through, but they managed to finish some of those projects. Like there were some projects, you know, sending up, you know, these high altitude balloons and doing different experiments. And, you know, I was all fun. I don't know if they like, yeah, I know that they went ahead and finally did some high altitude balloon experiments. And the time I was very interested in astrobiology and, you know, kind of this sort of space biology and things like that. So, I was coming up with like experiments around that focus. I don't know if they actually pursued that. But yeah, that was another opportunity where I started getting a little bit more involved in reading papers, that kind of thing. So, that was a really useful opportunity for me. And I was, yeah, really happy to be able to do that. And, you know. So, it sounds like a lot of your highlights are absolutely related quite strongly to your studies and your research, at least in that period of your life. Yeah, I guess so. It's not surprising because it's been, yeah, I mean, not many adults would have had those opportunities. The maybe a little bit different one. Yeah. I'm afraid I think there's anything else. That's fine. I'm not trying to push you in a different direction. I actually wanted to switch that on its head a little bit, if that's okay. Because like, yeah, I mean, I'm just thrilled to hear that you've had so many amazing opportunities and experiences and they've brought you joy and excitement. But, you know, I was wondering if you don't mind also sharing like what have been some of the toughest moments in your recently short career and life so far. And how have you dealt with those? Yeah, I mean, I kind of maybe have touched on a few already in terms of just like, a lot of it is dealing with naysayers and folks. What was that time being bullied in grade three? Would that be like up there or is that kind of far enough in the past now? During the time in community college also. So I was basically up until I graduated high school. And even after that, you know, even after I graduated high school, like I was taking community college classes and say, for example, chemistry and the professor was like, oh, I'm not sure if you're going to be able to carry through the labs and things like that. What did they mean by that? Well, I guess it's just more like being able to deal with, I guess, hazardous substances and stuff like that. They were worried that's not going to be possible with the, you know, I was at that time 10 years old. And Tanisha, just to clarify, does this feel like a tough memory because that kind of prejudice made you feel angry or sad, or is it just the way in which it was stopping you from doing the things you wanted to do or a bit of both? I think it was a bit of both. I think it was like a lot of it was definitely, I think it was very frustrating. That's what it was. It was, you know, frustrating and, you know, it's just like, yeah, there's a lot that you have to deal with. It just felt like, you know, I'm there to learn. And then it's like, you have to deal with all this other sort of like baggage in a way. Well, exactly. That's how it's like. I was actually talking to my wife, Rachel, today before I chatted to you. And it's like, I was kind of telling her what I wanted to talk about. And I kind of said, the way I see that period of life, it felt like you were saying, I want to be allowed to learn. And that there was some group of people who were saying you should not have that right. And that just seems so wrong to me. Right, right. I feel angry on your behalf. It's not even... Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, I mean, you can imagine how my parents felt, right? They were especially angry and frustrated with the administration, with the professors, all kinds of... Yeah. So it was... So yeah, I think that's a lot of where my frustration came. And then, of course, I certainly, you know, as I... I mean, even in like university, I think certainly you do have... I definitely had frustration dealing with certain students and things like that. And like I said, you know, some... What kind of things happened? Oh, just like, again, you know, certain... Like you mean more like teasing or... It's more like, again, like I said, working, you know, like they expect you to, you know, work overnight with them on things like... So there was a lot of, like, for example, tension with maybe like we had a senior design project and, you know, there's a lot of work that goes into that. And even though like... So like I was effectively kind of leading, you know, leading the team. Like I had, in fact, conceptualized the idea that we would work on and, you know, we decided that's what I'm going to work on and, you know, all of that. But even then, there's still like a lot of tension within the group because, you know, there's certain things I couldn't do. Like, you know, work at someone's, you know, stay at someone's apartment overnight to work on, you know, a report or, you know, whatever. And so I had... I mean, honestly, that feels pretty callous to me. I mean, they know that you're a kid. Like, it seems like I'm slightly shocked that people were... Yeah. Was it like maybe they just felt like you shouldn't be there at all and that this is their way of... I think... It was like, I think it was like certainly like this. I think the expectation was you should be like a normal college student, right? That's kind of the expectation. So I think they may be more willing to work. There's some issues working outside of those regular expectations. So, you know, there was a lot of tension definitely within the group, but, you know, eventually we managed to resolve that, you know, in a, I guess, an amicable manner finally at the end, but it was definitely... How did you do that? I think, I mean, at a certain point, I think there was also some involvement of, you know, the professors and, you know, I guess there was... I don't remember if like I... I don't know if I necessarily did anything, but I certainly, I think, certainly, I think they eventually did become more understanding and accommodating after some time. I think maybe when they realized they couldn't really push me to, you know, do these sorts of things. I mean, yeah, exactly. Like the outcome that's not going to happen is the 13-year-old acting like a 19-year-old because I went to 19-year-old. Yeah. And so there were certain things like that. And then, you know, of course, there's like, I think there was going to be a similar situation with a lot of the research that I would like undergraduate research expectations to be in the lab for, you know, some significant amount of time. But I think that was more, it's certainly a struggle with kind of more of balancing that with the classwork and things like that. Yeah. I mean, it sounds like quite often you were almost expected or required to... You were held to a higher standard than the other folks. Like you described earlier with like you had to get A's in your, you know, college. Certainly there was higher standards, but then certainly there were also like maybe standards that you would expect of a normal student. But, you know, my situation is different and maybe those are not the same standards that apply. I think there's also that aspect of things. So it's not necessarily higher, you know, just generally, but maybe higher for my particular situation. Again, that's the same point in terms of like getting fellowships and stuff like that. You know, my situation was completely different. Well, you know, maybe it's not as comparable to the situation of regular students, but that is what all the, you know, application committees considered. And, you know, for that reason, I didn't get any fellowships apart from one internal fellowship from UC Davis, but I went into grad school. And similar, yeah. And also with scholarships, it was very hard for me to get scholarships. And so in term, I think, yeah, like certainly there's, I think that that was also, yeah, basically there was that period basically between sort of like, yeah, as I was finishing up undergrad, kind of coming, you know, dealing with all the senior design kind of tension and going into grad school, maybe trying to figure out what is the next step and then trying to find a lab. Because, you know, there was, you know, I had planned to join this particular lab, but particularly lab. And yeah, again, there was another issue, again, things like rotations, lab rotations and stuff. Again, there just was, again, expectations. And I guess I wasn't able to meet those expectations. It was hard working that out. There was again, some tension in that scenario. I remember one rotation didn't work out because of some tension with one of the project scientists or postdocs or something like that. So there was like, at that time, there was a lot of like attention and definitely some concern about like, what lab am I going to join? And so actually in reality, I joined a lot quite late, actually compared to, you know, most PhD students. Because. What was that? So the tension you referred to, like what, what did that look like? What was, what was happening? It was more like, I don't know, it was like just trying to, the tension was more, again, lots of these are hands-on labs. There's expectation to be there, you know, from 9am to 9pm or whatever. And so I guess, you know, at the time that that wasn't something that, you know, again, I'm like only 14 or something. And then also there's this, there's also, you know, classwork and other things. But certainly, yeah. And then I guess certainly there may have been also some prejudice in terms of age as well. You know, I don't like, it's not, it's not an overt prejudice. It's not going to like show it very clearly, but I felt like that probably is still that under. But I mean, and that's part of the tough thing about prejudice and being different is it's almost, it's very, very rare you can actually definitively point at something and say this was due to prejudice. But at the same time, there's always going to be a big part of you wondering, which I think is. Yeah. This is what like my mom is always like, oh, they might be like, my mom always thinks like folks are prejudiced about like certain things. But it's like, like if you think about like, yeah, my mom is probably right. But like, you don't want to like believe like, how can everyone be like that? But like, you know, it turns out like, yeah, people do tend to sometimes feel threatened. And I think the same is like true now for my sister. You know, she's in this sort of very competitive field. Oh, wow. And music. Music and singing where, you know, there's a limited response and like, you know, trying to positions and, you know, she's very young and it's like, you know, she's trying to get positions and it's, it's very difficult. And there's definitely a lot of that bias and prejudice happening there as well. And so, you know, my mom is always like, calling that out. And, you know, it's like, you know, it's probably true. There's probably a lot of that happening. Then you just, but you just kind of don't want to believe like, how can people actually be like that? But it's just, you know, we're all like that. So, yes, they are. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So let's talk about the PhD. Yeah. I mean, let's, yeah, let's keep kind of going chronologically. So it was hard to find a lab and yeah, but what happened? How did you find something? And what did you find? So like, again, like the plan was like, okay, I'm doing some lab rotations, but then I was like, the backup was still the synthetic biology lab. But then eventually I was like, oh, but then I'm like, okay, I did some, I did a couple lab rotations. And as I said, a couple dropped out as well. And then this, this, that I was like going back to this synthetic biology lab, then he was like, I actually don't really want to have you on board. Or, you know, he wasn't interested in having me in the lab anymore. And this is after me, like, I was in the lab, the same lab for the entirety of my, like my undergrad, right? So I was in there for two years. Then even the summer after I graduated, it was like, if you're going to be in my lab, I want you to spend a few more months doing some hands-on work. So I spent like my, you know, like two or three months in the summer also working in his lab. Oh, wow. Even after that, and he was like, he didn't feel my research output was that great or, you know, it was not, it was not as, he didn't feel like his, the environment that he was providing was going to be the best environment for me, which I don't know if that was true. Yeah. That sounds like maybe they had kind of made that decision already. It's possible. I think, I think, you know, yeah, that may be possible. But, you know, maybe it is, it may have also been possible that if they were in that lab, it probably might not have been the best environment for me anyway. So. Well, I was going to ask, I mean, it seems like computational biology is a, seems like a fairly natural fit for you, which is kind of like what you're doing now, right? You know, it's like neural nets and whatnot, and not, not a whole lot of, you know, perpetuating hazardous materials. What he wanted me to do was like, like, so my undergrad research was mostly a lot of computational biology, but his lab is technically a synthetic biology lab. So, and then I think he wanted me to do some, yeah, yeah. I mean, I also was like, yeah, I don't know if I can do this, computational biology for entire PhD. So he wanted me to, you know, play around and do things like that in the lab. And so it was still, it was still a mostly synthetic biology lab where you have to do lots of hands-on work. And, you know, the students are there from, again, 9, 9.30 up to 9pm. And, you know, they're working long hours trying to get their experiments to, to work. So, yeah. So I don't know, in reality, maybe, you know, it was, it might not have been the best. Yeah. So what happened? So where did you have to, where did you go and how did that happen? Yeah. So then I was like, then, then that lab said, no, I was kind of like, really like, what am I going to do? And it's like, that was my backup and the lab really didn't work. And then, then I was like, what about doing some machine learning? Because at this point, you know, I started, you know, taking the fast AI course. So this is, I mean, this was in like early 2019. So like. Yeah. So I guess most people watching will know this, but the, so the fast AI course is my deep learning course. And so you are an alum of that course, which is entirely online. And so how old were you when you started that course? And, and, and, and why, why did you start that course? So I must've been 14 when I started the course. I was, I think I was just very interested in machine learning because it was just a hot topic at the time. And I think, so like I attempted to learn, yeah, I guess it's kind of going now into my machine learning path. But I, so I first, so like, I think I may have seen like things like Kaggle and stuff like that. I was like, oh, this is kind of really cool. So this is what I did in 2016. So I like, this is it. So I was like, you know, I checked out Kaggle. I took. Oh, sorry. I'm just going to keep filling in things. Again, I guess most people are going to know these things, but so Kaggle is the main kind of international competition platform for machine learning practitioners where I used to, you know, I was the president and chief scientist when it was started. So yeah, sorry to keep interrupting. No worries. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and the funny thing is like, you know, when you start with Kaggle, it's like, oh, like, you know, I think there's part of it, like, you know, I mean, when you first see it, you're like, oh, there's these are competitions and you can get, we can win money. And it's like, oh, wow. It's so cool. But then like eventually you're like, it's not about the money. It's just about the experience and learning. So I think it's pretty cool. Like, oh, wow. Okay. But then like you go into it and it's like, okay, it's, you know, it's more about the experience. It's very hard to, you know, and part of it is anyway. And the community, perhaps. I mean, there's a lot of, you know, people helping each other and stuff. Yeah. And there's a lot you can learn from Kaggle. And so, so this is in 2016, actually. So this is even before I went into my bachelor's, right. Before I went into UC Davis. So I checked out Kaggle. I then decided I'm going to learn some machine learning. So I actually took Andrewine's Coursera course. They're great. So I took that. So that's like one of the, again, one of the leading machine learning courses. I think Coursera was originally founded to, to hope that course. Yeah. With Daphne Kala. Yeah. Yeah. It's a really good course. And yes, but like, I think that's, again, still more like, from the basis kind of It's a bit more of an academic approach. Yeah. It's more pragmatic, like, yeah, like a typical approach. And I felt like it didn't really help my, you know, more of the practical side of things. Right. So I was still like playing around with Kaggle, but like, I feel I'm like, not like, I felt like my skills were not progressing anywhere. I'm not like improving in terms of, you know, how I'm doing in competitions, nothing like that. I feel like I'm not going about this the right way. So I, in fact, took a break from Kaggle and, you know, exploring that for a bit. Then I think I just, at one point I decided to visit it again in like late 2018. And I was seeing some nice Kaggle notebooks. So just to, I guess, fill in again, a lot of the, a lot of the, on the Kaggle platform, and especially with a lot of the complications, people will post, you know, example code and you can run that code and play around with it. Right. And, you know, like, it's like in a Jupyter, a lot of the times, Jupyter notebook. So it's got, you know, a lot of explanations and things like that as well. So it's a very good tool to just go over a lot of these notebooks, if, you know, just for learning purposes. So I think I'm just kind of interested in what's out there. And I, and I've noticed. And you have ended up becoming one of the only notebook grandmasters in the world on that. Oh yeah, that's true. Yes. Eventually I really like creating notebooks and again. Me too. I am also one of those. Yeah. Notebook grandmaster. And a lot of it was using the Fast.ai library. And it's funny because that's where I first discovered like the Fast.ai library was. Oh, okay. Notebooks. And I think it may have been like by, I think IA Foss or one of those, one of those, again, he's like a notebook grandmaster and he was, I think he wanted the notebooks. He was using Fast.ai and the notebook did very well in, in the competition as well. And I was like, okay, this is very interesting. And it looks very simple, but it's like doing very well. And I should check out this Fast.ai stuff more. And I actually remembered that I once saw Fast.ai on Twitter or something like this, and they had this course and like, I was like thinking about looking into that course a bit. And I think I may have watched like the first lecture or at least maybe the first 30 minutes of the first lecture or something like that. And I decided maybe I should dig into it more. So I found, so this was in late 2018. I'm just giving like a whole timeline of everything. Yeah, it's great. I love it. And then I took, I was, so I was, I went to the lectures, but I think that I've been to like the first two lectures, but then right after that, I think you released a new course, I think, or something like that. So then it's like, okay. So I think, yeah, I think you like released a new course, a new part one portion of the course or whatever. So then I was like, I'm just going to go through that. So then I've been through the entire course and at the same time. So you did part two as well, part one and part two. So I did part one was released. You had it released, right, to the full public. Then I went through part one. I was participating in the forums, asking my own question, answering other people's questions. Then as I was also going through part one, I looked at some cattle competitions. There was one, I think, like one of the audio classification competitions. And I kind of like participated with that. And I was like, I was so actually, at the end of the competition, I was actually very close to Brown's medal. I think I may have missed like by like five spots or something like that. But like, so like it was kind of disappointing, but also like, I felt like I was doing so much better than I was before. And I think like a lot of what I learned from FASTA, I really kind of provide lots of useful skills. And then on top of that, I was also playing around with, I decided, well, I'm interested, of course, in biomedical engineering, medicine in general. So I decided to take a medical AI dataset. So I looked at diabetic retinopathy, which is like, you know, often times they're, you know, imaging the eye, the whole set up. It was actually, yeah. So this is, this is diagnosing diabetes through eye images, which is very much a thing and something that it turns out mainly thanks to that competition, we've discovered that computers are extremely good at. Yeah, exactly. So this was, yeah, there's an older competition. And so I just took the data from that and I was just playing around with, you know, models of that and stuff. And it kind of did a systematic approach for, you know, stuff that I'm learning in the FASTA class, I'll apply it. So that's kind of how I went through the course. And did you then do the part two as well? I did the part two live. So I think I was invited through your kind of, I guess, your fellowship program, whatever it is, to the forums. And so I did part two actually, a live, you know, with the live streams. So for those who aren't familiar, like the part one course of FASTA-AI is kind of the introductory beginner level. I mean, it does take people up to kind of world-class best practices, but of specific, fairly well-developed and understood applications. Whereas part two is cutting edge research level, reading papers, implementing papers, trying out new things that haven't existed before. So it's, you know, lots of teenagers do part one. I think not many teenagers do part two. Yeah. So yeah, that was a really fun experience. And the other thing was like, I feel like I also learned a lot of like, you know, just general software engineering and stuff from both of these courses, which is also really, really useful and really helpful. But then, so that was part two, which ended, I think maybe somewhere in May or something like that. So that was around the time when also, you know, I was like in this kind of struggle to find a lab. And so, you know, I really enjoyed both. And was that the one, I'm trying to remember, was that the one where we did all the super resolution stuff with JSON-Antic or was that the year afterwards? I think it may have been, or no. I'm just asking because I know, I know you've, you know, ended up in image reconstruction for microscopy. I think it might be the year before. It might have been the year before. Down here was, I think the year, let's see. I think that would have been. It would have been that. Oh, wait, no, no, no, sorry. That was actually part one, 2019 was when we did it. Yeah. Yeah. So I think this is the year that we had the Swift stuff, I think. No, it wasn't. After 2019. No, that was 2019 as well. I think it was, oh gosh, it's all blurry. After 2019, did you do another part two? I don't think so, right? You did 2020. 2020 didn't have a part two. And then 2021? 2021 didn't even have a part one. Yeah. So then it was 2019, then that was the one with the Swift. And so I don't think you covered super resolution stuff. No, no, no. Well, actually the super resolution stuff actually was in part one of the course, believe it or not. It was lesson seven of part one. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. That may be right. I'm just looking at course 18.fast.ai to remind myself. Part two. Here we go. Oh, okay. So a lot of stuff that would be relevant to you. We did CycleGANs. That's when CycleGANs came out. Direct transfer. Our way to the first lot of super resolution actually was the end, lesson 14 of 2018. So, sorry, people who are not familiar with the field, this will all be total mumbo jumbo, but basically it's, you know, very strongly related to the, I mean, CycleGANs in particular is like literally what you researched out, right? Yeah. Out of it. But I actually took course 2019. So that was. Okay. But I definitely didn't look at a lot of those lectures still, you know, because I definitely knew about the super resolution stuff. I think. Yes. Okay. So 2019, lesson seven was when we did the really full on super resolution. Okay. So then maybe that's what I saw. Then that may be what I saw. We did GANs. We did UNIX. Yeah. So, so yeah, at that point I was like, okay, you know, I'm really liking this deep learning stuff. I even like a lot of my Twitter feed became about deep learning and it's following a lot of these folks and the deep learning field and that, that, that sphere. And so. So do you want to quickly describe what deep learning is and what it does? Okay. Again, I guess most people will know, but just to, you know, make sure nobody's left behind. You want me to explain or you want to? Yeah, I want you to explain. Oh, okay. I don't know. I can say things as well, but. I guess. It's definitely a good job. I mean, of course, you know, you hear all about AI and then this is kind of a sub subset of, of artificial intelligence, AI, where, you know, you apply these neural networks as they call them, but they're really just very, very flexible functions, I guess, that you're able to quote unquote train by, you know, passing in data. So it's just a kind of a different framework altogether in terms of programming. Usually you write down some rules and algorithms and then you run it on data and you get your results. But in this case, you take data and you pass it into your neural networks and you run these sorts of training processes. And then you get this sort of neural network at the end that is trained. Just learned how to do things. Yeah. Learns how to do things that you can't write the code for. The way I describe to people is it's basically deep learning is like the thing that's responsible for pretty much every amazing breakthrough in AI in the last few years. Yeah. You know, the fact that your phone, you can speak to it. That is thanks to deep learning. The fact that you can search your, you know, your photos for pictures of cats, even though you didn't say which ones have cats in that's thanks to deep learning. Yeah. Yeah. All those superpowers. Yeah. Okay. So you, yeah. So you started doing this before even settling on a PhD. Before, yeah. Before like, yeah, I started, I was dabbling in machine learning for a while, but then when I took the Fast.AI course, that's when I became really focused on this and I decided, okay, if I'm not joining this synthetic biology lab, then maybe I can join a, something more machine learning focused. So again, I found another lab and did a rotation in that lab. Unfortunately, also that didn't work out. So then this has, this is actually, you know, this was a, yeah, this was a machine learning lab, but again, I guess it was just not a good fit. I think it was more of a like, like, it was still kind of maybe molecular biology and things like that, but that was more, I think I was still more interested in more like medical aspects of stuff where it was like more applied. I think maybe that's also kind of, there was, you know, maybe the fit in terms of the research ideas and projects that I was interested in, maybe it wasn't really there. So then at this point, this is like end of summer of 2019. And most people, you don't get there, they join the lab, like, you know, if they, if they, the people in my batch, they would have joined a lab in like March and I'm like way behind here. So I even had special meetings. So were you feeling a bit worried at this point? I am very worried. Yeah, I was extremely worried. My parents were worried. What are we going to do? And so like I even met with the chair of the grad group a couple of times and then the chair at UC Davis. Yes, at UC Davis. And then, you know, he, he mentioned a couple of labs, a couple, a bunch of other labs that are doing more medical research with machine learning. And then, then he was like, and then he was like, this, this, there's this one lab that's also going to be joining it at the grad. So it hasn't actually joined the grad group yet, but it's going to join the grad this coming up year. And there was also, he was like, okay, maybe there's also other labs on campus, which if you're not part of the grad group and they may be able to join the grad group, that's something you're interested in. Because we were like, maybe there's not, there's not many good labs even in within the grad groups. And there are other labs in the university that I could join, but they could maybe join the grad group. So we're trying to figure out all kinds of situations, but still mostly focused on doing AI research because I figured, yeah, that was what I want to do. So, and then there was like a couple of labs that I, you know, I met with the, the, the professors and then I finally got to meet my current professor and like, he was joining the research and I thought it was quite interesting. And I felt like, again, it's like a medical research that was more directly applicable, right? This is like microscopy and pathology. And it's like actually talking, you know, working with how specimens in the clinic are being handled and examined. And it's like, if I can do good research of this, this is something that would have, you know, a positive impact more directly. At least that's how I felt at the time. And I mean, I still feel that way, but I'm saying that's, yeah, that's what, you know, how, you know, how it, how it looks like at, when I was looking at this research and, you know, almost immediately I was like, yeah, this is a good lab. I, I'm really, it just seems like there's lots of great deep learning opportunities. And I immediately kind of said, I'm going to join this lab. I didn't even do a rotation or anything. And I was like, yeah, I'm going to join this lab. And he was like, yeah. So, so what's, what, what's the name of the lab and who's, who are we talking about that's running it? Yes. This is Dr. Richard Levinson, which, yeah, he's a professor of pathology. So he actually has a background in pathology. So he, he did his MD a while back, like I think in the seventies. So this is like a long time. And then after that, he, you know, went to. And just to clarify again for people who are not sure, so pathology, my late passions explanation is like, kind of like looking at things like biopsies and whatnot, you know, under, under a slide, you know, maybe staining it a bit and then looking at the cells and so forth, trying to do a diagnosis and so forth. Is that roughly? Like if you need to, yeah, oftentimes to, especially like things like where, you know, the cellular information, like the actual cells in the body, you know, matter. And you need to take those sorts of samples and then, you know, analyze it under a microscope. And pathology covers other things as well, of course, like blood tests and whatnot. But I think your work is mainly around the medical imaging side of pathology, histopathology. Especially like, for example, a lot of it, like cancer, but I mean, we do, of course, there's other areas, but a very common application is looking at, you know, different cancers and, you know, you know, getting biopsies of different cancers and examining them under the microscope and providing a diagnosis. That's a very common application, but there's still. And so this is like, okay, so like I, I had already come across you through our forums. So Fast.ai has a very bustling forum community of deep learning nerds like me and Tanishq. And I'd never spoken to you directly, but I, you know, interacted with you on various threads and didn't, I had no idea. Like for a long time. I had no idea who you were. I think I had a sense that you were like surprisingly young, maybe, or even, I'm not even sure I knew that. I kept my profile like for a long time, actually pretty, like an anonymous profile. So like, I didn't actually put any information about myself on most of the machine learning, like even on Kaggle and stuff like that. I actually kept myself pretty anonymous for a while. Yeah, that's interesting. Also just interacting with people online. I think, you know. Is that basically so there would be no kind of expectations or prejudice or anything, but just interact with you for your work and nothing else? Or was it more accidental? Like, I mean, I think it was like, especially my, you know, I think it's something you hear from, you know, if my, I heard, you know, you hear from your parents, like, you know, be careful who you're interacting with online and like, you know, yeah, don't put a lot, you don't want to put too much information. So like, at the most, most of my sort of like public communication for, you know, my identity was there. It was mostly through Twitter and Facebook and then kind of mostly everywhere else. I was pretty much anonymous. Just, it was more kind of like, yeah, for safety, you know, for that purpose. But actually, but I, but I did know your supervisor, Richard, because I had started a medical AI company a few years earlier and medical imaging became our focus and histopathology was something we were interested in looking into and respects to Richard because he was doing really interesting work there. And then before my first chat to him, one of my colleagues said like, you know, I think I read something about this guy, something to do with pigeons and I looked up Richard Levinson pigeons and I'm like, oh my God, he's taught pigeons to diagnose disease through looking at histopathological slides, which is remarkable. Yeah. He's like, sometimes like to say AI stands for avian intelligence because of the pigeons. Because he, I mean, and he ended up, the pigeons got roughly the same level of accuracy as expert pathologists. And it's funny because you see things like, for example, like he used multiple pigeons and averaged out to predictions and it gets better. It's like, it's funny because like the techniques. An ensemble of pigeons. Yeah, exactly. An ensemble of pigeons. I mean, that's something. So he's obviously, okay. So like, based on the fact that A, he attempted to replace human pathologists with pigeons and B, he brought under his wing a kid to supervise on a PhD. He's obviously open-minded. Yes, he is. And or crazy or something. Yeah. I think, yeah, he's got unique ideas, like ideas, you know, a lot of people don't tend to think about. And I think that's, yeah. And you can see that like with his career, like he's got a very different career, right? Like his career was, you know, he did MD, but he never like really was much of a practicing pathologist. In fact, that he, like a professor, but then like after that he went into industry and he was actually working a lot in like hyperspectral cameras and stuff like that. So he was doing a lot of optics actually. And then even, you know, at his time in these companies working in this field, he actually started applying neural networks. So like very basic, you know, perceptrons, which is like the basic sort of neural networks, like very basic. Well, now he was already applying, this must have been in like early 2000s. So he has some, he already had actually some, you know, machine learning experience from that side of things. So, I mean, but like, you know, he's got a very unique path through, you know, through, you know, doing med, going to medical school and becoming, you know, this professor and then doing a degree. And eventually he was like, you know, he says like he got, I guess he got called to join UC Davis and he just joined UC Davis. And so, Tanishka, what was it like when you met him? Um, I mean, he was certainly a very, um, he was a very interesting, but very friendly character, right? He was like, you know, and he was like, you know, he was, he had, he has like the pigeon poster there in the, you know, we have it in the hallway of our lab. And so he's like showing that and he's showing, of course, the research. And so, you know, you know, he was very excited to show, and then we just connected about other things too, like he also was like, he's got like in like a musical background. So of course, um, he, I think was also like in the San Francisco Boys Chorus, just like I was, you know. Yeah. Which we hadn't talked about, right? So yeah, you're piano and choir, right? Is your. Yeah. I did, I did choir when I was younger, I played piano a bit. And like when I was, again, really young, then I think I just kind of, I, I, you know, both of them, I kind of stopped and like never really like pursued that any further. I know that feeling. Yeah. Which I think my parents were like, oh no, like, I mean, you know, we spent a lot of money on those things, but like. Yeah. I remember when I was like 13 or something and I said very earnestly to my mom, like I want to stop doing piano lessons. I'd done them since I was like seven. And she was like, are you sure? You know, one day you might look back and regret that. Cause it's like, you know, and I was like, no, I'm absolutely sure. I have no interest. And now I look back and I regret that. I think. Not that I've told mom, I wouldn't admit it to her unless she watches this, but you know. Yeah. Um, like piano is like, yeah, it's something like, I don't know, like, I guess like, yeah. I mean, of course they'll know like base, very basic stuff, of course, but like, I don't like choir is something like, I think, I think now it's like at the time, like, yeah, definitely. I think I wanted to continue at the time. So like, I wasn't far from like maybe five years old to 10 years old, something like that. So I was there for like five years or whatever. Um, and I was, so I was there for quite some time and, um, and so yeah, I was, I kind of wanted to continue, but then the thing was I became a full-time student. So I'm like a full-time student where I was taking, you know, I graduated high school and I went to community college. And I was a full-time student taking multiple classes per semester, as opposed to the standard two classes. So it wasn't working because this is in San Francisco and I live in Sacramento and it was like an hour and a half drive, you know, both ways. It's like three hours just driving. And this was like two days a week. So that's like six hours in a week is just got gone in, in, you know, just, you know, in the car. And, you know, that was, so it was like, there's a lot of time commitment, you know, even just the regular classes or like, again, like two hours. And then the, like, if, when you get closer to the actual concerts or like multiple rehearsals, because like San Francisco voice course is like one of the top voice courses in the world. Right. It's like, actually like San Francisco voice course and like the Vienna voice course or something like that. These are like top courses in like voice course in the world. So like they're very top notch and very professional. And so, and actually I got to, you know, I actually got to sing, like, for example, I also sang the national anthem at the Giants game actually. Amazing. Wow. I had no idea. Yeah. So even I've sung the national anthem and also for the Oakland A's. So maybe you and your sister can swap sometime and she can start doing the fast AI course. Yeah. But like, so I, and if any, like, I think, yeah, that's kind of where my sister, like became really passionate about music actually, because she sometimes coming into a lot of my, you know, classes, my, my, maybe, you know, my mom is driving me and she's taking my sister along and my sister really was like enjoying that. It's like, why can't I sing in the chorus? It's a voice chorus. Oh, you can just sing. But then she became really passionate about music at that point. I mean, she's, you know, it's already kind of playing around with like singing like that. She's not like, why can't I train neural nets? No, she's not like that. Unfortunately. I would be happy if she was like that, but that's not, no. But yeah. So actually in a way, like that kind of maybe jumps, maybe helps with her interest in that. So, you know, there was some benefit, but then I think, so like I was finished. Yeah. As I went into community college, I couldn't take this. It was not working out in terms of the time commitment and stuff. So I stopped, but at the time, it was something that was pretty kind of, I wasn't, I was kind of sad about it, but like, I, you know, I definitely realized that, you know, like the community college is, you know, more important to me. So, you know, that was a worthwhile sacrifice for me, but like, you know, there was still like some aspect of it. Anyway. So this was something you had in common with, with Richard. Yes. That was something I had in common. And then he also has like a, like he knew, like, I think he knows some of them, he knew like relatives of like one of these famous composers and stuff. And he's just like a generally also like a musically minded person, like goes to a lot of the concerts at UC Davis and things like that. So we were just kind of connecting over that too. And especially, you know, you know, how my sister is also very interested in that kind of field. And so was that like a pretty, like, did that all go pretty smoothly then? Like you guys connected and it's like, okay, this is obviously going to happen. Yeah, a good connection. And so, yeah, I think at that point it was definitely something like, yeah. The funny thing was like, so he was talking about the cycle again and research because like, this is something like he was interested in pursuing already. So this was like something that he's interested in. He was interested. Yeah, because I think I spoke to you guys pretty early on. We were already interested in pursuing that. Yeah. So that was like, already like, let's do this. I remember we had a call and he was like, oh, you might know this guy. He's, you know, from your community. And I was like, oh yeah, I do kind of. Yeah. So, yeah, immediately he was like already interested in CycleGAN stuff, but it was kind of funny because like up to that point I was playing around with all this classification and segmentation or what is like different machine learning tasks. And then, but like these sort of generative tasks, which is like what the CycleGAN stuff. Like I wasn't. Yeah. So CycleGAN is like a technique for taking an image and turning it into a different image. Exactly. And that would be very useful in particular in pathology. If you could take an image, which is easy, fast and cheap to acquire and turn it into an image, which is slow and expensive and difficult to acquire, but has like useful features for diagnosis, whatever. Is that kind of idea? Basically, yeah. The research in a nutshell that I do. Yes. So, but like those were techniques I hadn't played around with in the past. And, you know, honestly, I didn't, at the time I didn't find it that interesting, but then I was like, you know what, give it a try and still deep learning. And it's still going to be, I think it'll still be fun. So I mean, that's what I decided. Like I didn't, I wasn't actually expecting to like really, I wasn't sure if this is something I'd actually enjoy, but like I figured like this deep learning and this is like still very cutting edge. And, you know, I, again, the application is what matters to me the most, I think, you know, that it has a useful application at the end. So I decided to give it a try. And now I'm like really all over this sort of generative, these sorts of, you know, machine learning tasks. And so that was kind of funny. But yeah, like you mentioned, like this was something we wanted to do early on. So like he would say, you know, this is a project that I'm interested in. He had some other projects too, but this was like the one I figured like, okay, I'm going to give this one a try. There's like one other project that he also suggested and I gave that a try, but then I didn't find it as interesting. So this is the one that I really pursued. And then, I think I saw like, for example, I think I, so I saw, I think the talk with Jason Antic at like Facebook or something. I think that means... So I just discovered his, we're meant to pronounce his name Jason Antic, by the way. So even though I've been butchering it for the last few years, so yes. Okay. Jason Antic being, you know, another fast AI alum who's gone on to great things. He started a startup based on exactly these kinds of techniques, but in his case, it was taking black and white photos and taking them into color photos. Yeah. So like I saw the talk and I was like, wait, this was something that we talked about, like in the lesson, right? And I was like, well, this is something that maybe would work well here. And like, these are some of the techniques that I think we should examine and study. So I brought that up to my professor, Dr. Lemonson, and he was like, oh, I know Jeremy. I was like, wait, how do you know Jeremy? And it's like, it turns out like he knows like a lot of people, right? So he knows like, I think he knows you. Yeah, he knows you. He knows, like he knows Daphne Kohler. Yeah, she's the one who was doing like, also, I think she's doing pathology stuff too now. Yes, she was. So she was involved in the computational pathologist CPath project at Stanford with Andy Beck. Well, but I think that the startup that she's working on is still also, I think it's called In-Citro or something like that. Yeah, that's right. She ended up going after, after co-founding Coursera, she then founded a part of the thing at Google's. Yeah. Yeah. So she was, she knows, she was, so he knows her and he knows a lot of people in the field, not just like in pathology, but in deep learning and like in all these different fields. And I'm like, wait, that's another thing about how to, you know, this sort of PI, he's very well connected, which is also really nice to have, like, you know, it's good to have people who are, you know, well connected and can get you the resources that you need. So like, even, you know, of course, like, you know, there are researchers who are, you know, the leading researchers in the field. So like, he knows all the computational pathology researchers, like pretty much all of them. And so like, I, you know, I'm more. So how old would you have been at that time when we were on that call together with Richard? Yeah, I'd be like 15, maybe 14, 15. Yeah. So, so I mean, like, I, the thing I've really noticed about you, Tanishka, in the last four years is like, how much you've developed as a person, like really, I mean, you know what I think of you, because I've actually said it publicly in the Fast AI course, you know, I think you're incredibly, like, I mean, obviously smart and hardworking, but also thoughtful and generous and kind and fair. Yeah. And, you know, I honestly, when I was first chatting to you, I kind of felt like you were pretty raw, you know, you were, you, you, you're, you know, a nice enough guy and certainly smart and good to work with, but I, I, I wouldn't have tried to put you up as one of the, you know, in the same way, but like, over the last four years, it seems to me like you've really grown out as a person into somebody who's, who's, who's very special, a very special human being. Like, do you feel like you've, you've realized that as I'm, you know, living my life? So that's very interesting to hear for sure. Like, you know. Yeah. No, it's quite striking for me, you know, and, and, and, and interesting to like, I, you know, whether it's like, is it just, you know, there's actually a lot of years between being a 15 year old and a 19 year old, but also like working, you know, on a doctorate, you're, you're part of a team and people are relying on you and you're having to navigate situations, but not, not as a precocious kid who's trying to force their way into things that hasn't been designed for them, but as a colleague, you know, and, yeah, so, you know, maybe there's just that, that, I don't know, I don't know where I'm going with this, but I've been interested to hear what your thoughts are about the experience of like doing a PhD and whether that was quite a, yeah, different experience to the before. So actually this goes back, it's interesting you bring that up in terms of like being a kid who's like trying to do, because like, so like, like even if I'm a bachelors, like at a certain point, like people don't, most people don't realize, like if they're meeting me for the first time, they don't realize that I'm young. Like, I mean, oftentimes I'm not going to mention that, you know, the first time I'm like, I'm going to say, hello, I'm Tanisha and I'm 19 years old. That's not how I'm going to introduce, especially if it's like directly related to research, that's not obviously not how I'm going to do. So even though I'm a bachelors, I think, like I've taken a couple of classes where I went the entire class and no one knew, you know, anything about me. And I was like, that's fine. I don't really care. But like, I think of course, within the, within the actual, my actual class of the, the biomedical engineering batch or whatever, they all knew because, you know, that news is going to spread pretty quickly, but outside of like, you know, taking other classes and stuff, a lot of them didn't realize that I was so young. And the same is true, I think when I, in my PhD. So yeah, I mean, I think like, I think it was like, I think after like, it's like after 13 or 14, I think, you know, you don't really realize that you can, if you look at me, you don't realize that. I think a lot of people don't realize that young. I mean, some people will still say you look kind of young and, but they don't like, you don't bring it up. Like oftentimes they don't bring it up until like, sometimes maybe I might mention it in passing or something. They're like, wait, you've been, you look young and you know, that makes sense actually now, like, but in my PhD and I'm doing stuff, you know, most people don't realize my age. I think there may be, maybe a couple of collaborators. I don't know if they know my age or not. Like I never bring it up. And I just interact as I would as a regular, yes, it's just a regular researcher. I imagine that feels pretty good. Sorry? I imagine that feels pretty good. I mean, you know, cause like, it seems like you, you had years of trying to prove that you deserve to be somewhere, you know, and kind of like, and also like not really being able to quite do the same things in the same ways as everybody else. Yeah. That must be a real nice change. Yeah. Like, yeah, I felt, yeah, I definitely feel like, well, I think there's still some, I mean, at this point it's like, some of it is like, I do think like sometimes I'm worried if I'm like, you know, behind in terms of research output and things like that. And still a concern that I do have. I think, I think it was, I think it's less of a concern now because like, I'm seeing the end of the tunnel and I'm seeing like, yeah, I'm going to get like, you know, a few papers and, you know, I've done like good research and, but I think I was beginning the, the, the, again, beginning my PhD and beginning the, and even that original phase in, in Dr. Lemonson's lab, I was still kind of worried about that. How's that research output going to look like? I mean, those are all very normal PhD reactions though. It, it, they are, but also, yeah, I don't, well, the other thing is like, again, it just depends like, yeah, I think, I think there's certainly a lot of like comparing to, you know, you compare to others and you kind of see, it always seems like, you know, that's, it's, it's not the best thing to be doing, but it's still like, you know, something that kind of naturally happens, right? Like, of course, you know, you shouldn't compare yourself to others. You should be comparing yourself to yourself and, you know, easy to say that's what, that's what people say, but it's still, you know, hard to, you know, practice what people are saying in terms of, yeah, no, I mean, the people that say that probably don't practice it. So, you know, there's definitely still that aspect of thing, you know, I'm seeing like my, my colleague, you know, my colleagues, I don't think that like five, 10 papers and like, oh my gosh, I only have like one or two or like, the other thing is, you know, I'm definitely in this different, I mean, in a different environment. A lot of them have labs that, you know, have 10, 20 people, maybe, you know, even larger than that. They're working a lot of collaborative projects. In my case, my lab was actually a very small lab, actually. I'm the only PhD student in the lab, which is a very unique situation to be in. And a lot of, and I'm actually Dr. Levinson's first PhD student. So we're actually co-operating at the same time, the PhD, you know, process. So, and then, so, you know, there's, it's a very... But now you have quite a few papers to your name. Yeah, I do have some papers. So I'm definitely, you know, proud of that. And I'm seeing... And a book, at least one book chapter that I'm aware of. Yes. Yeah, that too, which that was luckily something that, you know, I got that opportunity, you know, shortly after I joined the lab. So I was very happy about that. And so these sorts of opportunities definitely, you know, put my worries at rest. I mean, you know, still you kind of, I still kind of worry about it once in a while, but I definitely feel like I'm in a much better situation now. But, you know, apart from, I mean, yeah, as you said, those are probably regular PhD worries. But yeah, apart from that, you know, I'm definitely very satisfied, I guess, the path that I've been taking in terms of, yeah, the PhD seems to be going well. Yeah. It's like a regular PhD. And... Yeah. Except for the fact that you, you know, now also have a job, a very interesting and exciting job. I guess we're like, I just, I wanted to kind of ask, like... I just want to mention one other thing. Yeah, please. I was going to say, like, I really enjoy, you know, of course, doing this sort of computational research, right? Like, it's very, it works. I think that's something that, you know, for the longest time I tried to do this sort of hands-on research. And I guess that's just something that, you know, just doesn't maybe work as well for me. But then the computational stuff, it's very flexible, you know, but I, you know, I can still get a lot of my work done wherever I am. And it's really nice, you know, especially, you know, during the pandemic, you know, all the other students, they couldn't complete any of their research and things. Oh, wow, yeah. Got down, right? So, but I've managed to still, you know, continue with my research, actually. Absolutely. But also like computational work, like, you, you know, you, we create stuff that didn't previously exist out of raw code, you know, and we can create lots of things and we can try them and we can compare them. And it's like such an act of creation, you know, and creating things is just magnificent. Like, that's how I feel about it. Yeah. It's again, like, I think it's always good to like get external perspective on these sort of things, because like, you know, as I do research, like, you know, it just feels like, oh, is this the research that I do on a day to day basis? And it's like, okay, this is what I'm doing. And like, I'm also like, you know, analyzing the results. It's like, oh, this is not perfect. And like, this is issues here, and this issue is there. And like, oh, I gotta figure out how to improve it. But then I like this, this project I'm working on, I'm working on with some collaborators, and I'm showing these results to the collaborators. And they're like, this is, this is amazing. And this is like stuff that wasn't possible before. And like, this is like, you know, you could, you couldn't really get, you know, these sorts of images ever, right? Like, because this collaborator that we're working with, and it's like, actually doing in vivo imaging, or kind of like, it's not necessarily in vivo, it's like during a surgery, during imaging and stuff like that. And it's like, you know, getting the same sorts of images that you get with the standard pathology workflow and doing that sort of conversion, like you mentioned, going from this cheap and easy approach that you can do within the surgery to this more expensive approach that you could ever do within a surgery. And it's nice for me, because I, you know, as you know, was somewhat accidentally doing similar things to you, but at the Salk Institute, you know, again, kind of microscopy, image reconstruction stuff. And yeah, same thing, like the folks that we worked with took that work and literally mapped a brain connectome, you know, as just like, wow, that's, you know, nobody's ever seen that before. Yeah. So it's like that kind of aspect, like, yeah, and take a step back and like, yeah, no one has been able to do this before, or like, you know, no one has seen this sort of thing before. Right. So then, especially when you hear that external input and feedback from people, then you kind of realize it. But, you know, on a day-to-day basis, it's hard to kind of... Well, it is, because particularly on a day-to-day basis, training deep learning models is extremely tedious and frustrating. At least it is for me. No, it is frustrating and tedious. And then also a lot of the work I do is like working with images and like, you know, so like this sort of approach that I take with the research. And I think this is, again, an approach that Dr. Lemonson has also like really pushed for, is, you know, kind of focused on the data. And like, you know, he always likes to say garbage in, garbage out, which is a common zane. So, you know, there's a lot of focus on the data and making sure the data is the best quality. And so a lot of my work also involves working with the data and just analyzing the data and, you know, cleaning up the data, things like that. And so that's a lot of tedious work in that aspect of things as well. So, yeah, there's definitely a lot of tedious work that goes into it. And sometimes, you know, sometimes it's not as maybe flashy as, you know, inventing a new method altogether and things like that, but it still has a, you know, a useful impact and, you know, has a useful application at the end. So, yeah, I think that definitely motivates me that, you know, you do get something that, you know, could have a difference. And, you know, that doesn't necessarily need to be with flashy new architectures. It can be with, you know, sometimes boring architectures. Like the CycleGAN is actually a very old architecture, but it works surprisingly well, especially when you give it the right data. And so those are the sorts of things it's like, you know, giving it the right data, what other picks can we use, things like pre-training, stuff like that. Sorry, these are actually bad words that I'm, you know, saying. And what's like, I'm kind of like, you know, curious thinking as a parent, what's kind of like, you know, your parents, particularly your mom, you know, were heavily involved in teaching you stuff. And your mom was there at a community college, you know, doing the theology with you, whatever. Have you been like, taking them along for the ride? Like, do they know what CycleGANs are and stuff like that? Are they like, or how much are they telling them about what's, about, you know, your research? Yeah. I mean, I talked to them about it. So, I mean, they definitely have an idea. I don't think they maybe fully understand the nitty gritty details. But, you know, sometimes they'll joke, oh, you talk about it, but CycleGANs and, you know, all the different words that I, you know, talking about my research and like, they'll be, you know, sometimes joking about it. But I do talk about it. It's probably easier for them to appreciate your sister's work than your work, I guess. Yeah, that's definitely true. That is a good point. Yes. No, I think that is definitely very true. Yeah, that's, yeah. But then, like, I mean, I still like also practice sometimes my presentations with, you know, with my parents, like, like some of them will still practice. Like, yeah, like, I'm like, I've done that since I was very young, and I still do that. And that, so they certainly have an understanding of kind of the general ideas of my research, but not, of course, of the nitty gritty details. But yeah, I think they're also kind of amazed. And, you know, I also, they of course, give a lot of the sort of external feedback, you know, that they're also very amazed by what I'm doing. And it's like, yeah, again, it's like, I do you kind of, yeah, it's like, okay, maybe, maybe it is kind of interesting, but like, I feel like this is like normal. And like, and sometimes I'm also feel like I'm not doing enough, right? Like I want to do more, and I always want to do more, but they're like, you've done a lot already. And it's like, yeah, sometimes it's nice then to hear that, and then, then kind of take that step back and kind of realize that. And have you been talking to them about like your, have you been talking to them about like, you know, like, joining stability and like, you know, and I think it's a route of work. I mean, I talk to them about all these things, like everything I'm involved in, and they, they're there to provide, you know, a lot of advice and feed and support. And, you know, they help, they help me out a lot in that sort of aspect. So there's a lot of, yeah, it's very, I'm lucky to have a lot of that family support. And, you know, I try to rely on that, if as much as possible, if I can. So, yeah, so they're very, you know, proud and excited of what I'm doing at stability as well. And, you know, they've been, you know, they've also, yeah, they, yeah, they're just also very excited as well. So, like, are you kind of like almost at a, at a new stage now? Like, it feels like, like, from what I've heard you say, both in interviews when you were younger and today and chatting to you, like you had this long running dream, you know, of like medical, biological research, get a PhD and in March or whenever that, that will be done. Does that feel like kind of like completing a certain stage of your life, you know, and like, and like, did you always have dreams about what happens after that? Or are you now kind of like moving into uncharted territory or how does that feel? So, so I don't know, you know, I've definitely mentioned in the past that I want to go to medical school, right. And then that was like something, like that's something I'm still, so the reason, of course, I want to go to medical school is to make an impact with medical research and still in that avenue. But I've been thinking, you know, I've kind of been thinking about that and if that's something I want to still do. And I think I've been kind of like talking to people about that now. So, like, I mean, I'm certainly going to take like a couple years off, I think, you know, one or two years, definitely like as a break. But if I am going to go to medical school, yeah. You need a couple of years off study. Exactly. Yeah. Because then you get a medical school and another like, you know, it's a lot of memorizing and more studying. And, you know, I've done that for, I don't know, for a very long time. Right. And also medical school is very specifically, you know, like in a lot of ways it is a trade school, you know, which is teaching the trade of being a doctor, which is not really what you're trying to do. Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is, I guess part of me believes that like that is really an important skill to have if you want to kind of maybe understand, you know, what things need improvement and need change in the field. And I think it's also like, like the way I've always thought about it was like, if I'm a practicing doctor, then I get to have more hands on experiences with patients and understand better the sort of challenges that patients are facing. But then, of course, there's also that aspect, like maybe you don't need to do that. You can just talk to doctors and talk to patients. And maybe that's not a requirement. So I'm still trying to figure out maybe what is the, you know, what is the aspect. It almost reminds me of like me now being a homeschooling dad and trying to learn about teaching. And I spend dozens and dozens and dozens of hours listening to interviews with teachers. And like I hear them describing their challenges and frustrations and processes and whatever. And yeah, it's not the same as going to, you know, to school to learn to be a teacher and then practicing being a teacher. But the difference, you know, in terms of like percentages, like one percent of the work or 50 percent of the upside or something, I don't know. And again, I think the difference is you're still doing the teaching, right? You're doing the teaching with your daughter, right? That's true. I am. You're still having a hands on experience and you have that experience to kind of learn from. Yeah. And I guess I have more expertise in teaching my daughter than anybody else in the world. Exactly. And so, well, yeah, like I was saying, like, yeah, I think, I mean, as you said that, you know, you are, of course, the expert in teaching your daughter. And I think like to a certain extent, you know, doctors are the expert in, you know, treating their patients. So I think there is value potentially in going to medical school and becoming a doctor. There may also be value in going to medical school and not necessarily becoming a doctor, but still that process of going to a medical school. I've seen people who've done that and they seem to make a huge impact. I think recently I heard a talk by someone from Stanford who did that sort of process and he's done, you know, he's been through medical school and then he's been into industry and, you know, informing several startups, you know, creating medical devices and getting them to clinic. And he's now a professor at Stanford teaching those sorts of same principles. But like, you know, he clearly got a lot of value also out of that medical knowledge. So I think, so yeah, I guess, you know, it's something I'm trying to explore right now and figure out what is the best path. And then similarly, it is also something I have to figure out what to do right after I, you know, finish my PhD because the medical school stuff is, you know, a couple of years down the line, but the PhD, you know, after PhD is just six months down the line. So I'm trying to figure that out right now too. So I have, you know. So what's the kind of like, what's the North Star or whatever that's guiding you in these thoughts? What does, you know, where do you want to be in 10 years or 20 years or 40 years? Yeah. It's, yeah, it's not like, it's certainly true. Like, I think, like, you know, it was, that's something I kind of like, I mean, I just want to be able to make an impact, right? So I think it's part of it's like, you know, getting something to the clinic is kind of my goal in life. Just having something that, you know. Something that's helping people to not be sick. Exactly. Yeah. So I think there's many paths to that. So it's just like, what may be the best path for me personally? There's, of course, you know, academia, which has its advantages, but also many disadvantages. There is, of course, industry. Again, there's a lot of, you know, again, this is a similar situation. There's still disadvantages and advantages with industry. So it's kind of weighing those up. Yeah. I mean, if I could like add my perspective, because in a sense, my question's not quite fair because I feel like it's like asking somebody what their favorite color is. You know, we don't actually necessarily have a favorite color. And when you're younger, I think a lot of us do as kids have like, what do you want to be when you grow up? You know, but actually, at least for me, I got to a point where what I really want to do is capture opportunities as they come along. And like, you know, from time, you know, from moment to moment be living my best life with an overarching thesis, you know, and my thesis is very much about like, kind of accessibility and fairness and, you know, opportunities for everybody and lack of gatekeeping. And then, you know, I think about like, well, where are my skills and what can I do at the moment? And, you know, so like, yeah, as I mentioned, I don't, you know, don't feel like you have to, you know, have some 20 year plan. Opportunities that you have, you want to catch, right? Because like stability is kind of like one of those opportunities because stability is kind of like, and like, I didn't know existed a year ago. I didn't, and it's kind of funny, like a year ago. So Stability AI is a company which has just raised about a hundred million dollars and it's basically doing exactly what you and I have been talking about with our research, generative modeling. So it's creating images, sounds, texts, whatever that didn't previously exist or reconstructing those things in interesting ways using deep learning. Yeah. And the CEO is an ex hedge fund guy named Emad who's, you know, in the papers and New York times podcast and whatever else. And yeah, I mean, so how did you find yourself at Stability AI? Did you reach out to him? Did he reach out to you? Yeah. So like, yeah, again, so yeah, it's just to kind of say like how I knew about Stability AI, like I didn't know about Stability AI, like say a year ago, I had seen a couple of things about it. I think, I think for example, I think Afram Krausen, who's like one of the leading researchers in this field of AI art and image generation and stuff like that. I saw like she was like getting, getting supported by Stability AI. And that was like the only thing I've seen about Stability AI basically, and like entire online presence at the time, this is like January of 2021, 2022. So like, yeah, basically the beginning of this year. And there was a part of that, there's like no online presence of this company. But Emad, yeah, Emad was like in the, in the Discord servers. So, you know, there's one of the Discord servers, which is Eluther AI. This is again, one of these sorts of... So this is a popular text chat system. Yeah. So yeah, this is a kind of a, you know, the Discord server was mostly focused on, you know, deep learning research. The Eluther AI is known for some of their sorts of, they have generated, like developed some of these sorts of open source versions or kind of replications of models like GPT-3 and things like that, like these sorts of, again, generative models, but this was more focused on text instead of images. So they have done like actual solid research. And I think some of the datasets that they've created datasets, and I think these datasets are actually used by a lot of these industry labs and things like that even now. So I was, you know, I've been, I've been hanging around in that server, you know, you know, talking about research and other sorts of things. And so I think at this point, I was specifically looking for GPU resources. Oh, and actually, it's funny that I mentioned that because we never actually talked about, you know, the sort of support that, you know, was given to what you would provide it actually, right? Because originally, a lot of my research was provided, the support in terms of like compute resources and GPU resources, and also some expertise was provided through this organization that Jeremy leads, VAMRI. He was at, he led this at USF. And so actually, that was kind of when we met with Dr. Lemonson, you know, talking about research, that was kind of the outcome of that meeting in terms of me working with VAMRI. I have an idea about that, by the way, which I'll talk to you about after our interview, perhaps. Yeah, that'd be great to talk about. But anyway, so, you know, I got a lot of support from there in terms of compute resources and GPUs, because that's, of course, a huge limiting factor in terms of AI research. But if you still... Yeah, the computers are expensive. Yeah, GPUs are expensive. But even if you have like, you know, a few good GPUs, you can still do a lot of great research. I mean, I'm not like using thousands of GPUs, actually, in my own research, I'm just using a few GPUs, they're still like high end GPUs. And so some people may find, oh, it's like a very, but it's still like nothing compared to like the thousands of GPUs used to create these huge models. But I think, so yeah, I got some of that support through VAMRI, they were providing those resources. And I also worked with some great people there. Andrew Shaw, who was, again, I think he's also the Fast.ai alumnus. And also Daniel O'Connor, he was a professor at USF. And so I was working with them. And, you know, that was a very great collaboration. But then, unfortunately, you know, the VAMRI, I guess, arrangement kind of had to shut down. So then I was able to find another like short term grant for a few months. And then that lasted till January. And so now I still need resources for compute to complete my research. So I kind of just like messaged in the chat, like, oh, I'm running out of compute, I don't know what I'm going to do. And I was just like, just kind of like a general message or something like that. And then he just like, you know, replies. He replies with like a single wave emoji. And he was like, like, oh, hello, what are you, why are you waving? Is there something that you can help out with? And he's like, yeah, we can provide GPUs. And he was and so then we started DMing and he was talking about stability AI and what the goals were. And he was, you know, he said that he can provide GPUs for research. And also, he even offered to then support my own research and, you know, provide a fellowship. And that's because he said like, he was any he's that's something that a program that he was starting is, you know, providing these PhD fellowships to, you know, researchers in AI. So I was one of the first folks to receive that fellowship. I think it was actually. And so he provided that to me as well. And so this was, you know, back in like January, February or so. And so since then, I've actually, you know, been kind of involved in like, you know, knowing what's going on and like kind of helping out here and there, not officially an employee, but, you know, getting support now through the, you know, through the compute, but then also through the, you know, through the fellowship. But of course, the fellowship was specifically for my PhD and, you know, those stuff. And so since then, I've, you know, been involved and I knew like some things were happening. And I was like, oh, this is kind of cool. Like what's going on here? And, you know, the whole stable diffusion stuff started happening and picking up. And this was like, by then it was like July and August. And it was like, you know what, I think I might want to join this company and help out and actually be part of this. And yeah, so I joined in, I think, August, September. Yeah, it's definitely history being made in real time. Yeah. Yeah. So it was very exciting because like, yeah, he's the kind of guy who's like, you know, he's very like, down to earth in terms of like, you know, it's not like he's like, you know, you think like he's an ex hedge fund manager and he's like, you know, he's the CEO of this big company, like, kind of like nowadays, like, you know, big company, you know, he's getting interviews by all these people, you know, you don't really like, he's like, still pretty down to earth and like talks to everyone. And, you know, he's, he's very active in some of his Discord servers and will talk to folks about stuff. And like, so, you know, that's how I first interacted with the Discord server. And then it's kind of interesting to see everything kind of play out and, you know, my involvement in that as well. So it's very exciting and I'm very lucky to have discovered this and be supported by him as well and by Stability AI. So, yeah. Great. Let me ask you something at a more meta level, which is, you know, it's, it's interesting that you mentioned that, you know, as a very young child, you know, you had an IQ test and you performed highly on that and, you know, so there's obviously this intelligence thing going on. But like, interestingly, from my point of view in working with you, I wouldn't say the thing that most stands out is like, wow, he's way smarter than everybody, but actually, wow, your, I don't know if it's actually work ethics, the right word, but your, your, your way of working is better than most people I work with. Like you reliably tend to follow through on the things that you say you're going to do at more or less the time you say you're going to do them. You generally speaking, don't express opinions about things with which you're unfamiliar, and when there's a paper or whatever that comes out, you actually read it before you start talking about it. Like, these are all things that sound normal and obvious, but they're not at all, you know, like very few people actually read the papers and very few people actually do the things that they say they're going to do at about this time they say they're going to do them. And like, I really enjoy that about working with you because I feel like I can actually have, you know, sensible conversations that are fact-based and are going to have follow up and yeah. So it's kind of interesting to me that you're clearly a bit of an outlier on two axes that don't necessarily correlate, you know, which is something about kind of, you know, hard work and reliability and, and not no bullshit, you know, as well as intellect. So like, where does that kind of, you know, getting things done and actually doing the reading and, you know, the fact that you have this like paper reading group and you make sure it happens each week and you make sure that there's somebody to present and you, like, it's, again, it's not rocket science, but as somebody, I'm normally the person who organizes things because nobody else does. So it's nice for me to discover somebody else in the world who actually does things reliably as well. Yeah. I don't know. Like, where do you feel like this is coming from? Is this something that you've worked hard to make happen or is this just natural to you? Well, first of all, I've personally, personally, I feel like I'm not a hugely organized person. So like, it's kind of interesting to hear that, to be honest. I mean, I'm not either, but like, it's just a case of like, just doing the things you say you're going to do. You don't have to be terribly organized. You just don't totally flake out, you know. I think, I don't know, like, the thing is like, also I feel like sometimes like, you know, there's like, like when you say, what do you mean by like doing what you say you do? Because like, I guess maybe, yeah, because like, okay. So for example, you say, okay, we're going to have a paper club. It's going to be each week. This is the time it's going to be, you know, well, that actually happens, you know, and, and you, you know, or you say like, I say like, oh, I want to interview you for podcast and you're like, okay, well, what times are going to be? And you are there at that time and you make sure, I don't know, like, I mean, I've been around a couple of times, but it's like, it's follow and definitely the papers thing. It's like, not many people read the papers, really, but somehow still have opinions because of like something they read on Twitter or something. And you tend to be like, okay, yeah, I read the paper in this section. I saw this thing. I don't know. I think you're, I think you're reliable and, and authentic and honest. And. Because like, oftentimes like, um, like a lot of projects, like, you know, I feel like, like there's a lot, like I have a lot of projects, right? Like there's so many projects and sometimes projects kind of, you know, slip, slip my mind or, you know, just kind of, you know, they just become less priority. So like, for that reason, oftentimes I feel like maybe I'm kind of flaky in certain aspects, but so that's what, like when I was, when I was asked. I haven't experienced that. So maybe that's just, oh, okay. I'm just revealing my, my flaws now. Well, I mean, no, I mean, instead of, I was just going to say, it's not a flaw. Like it's like, that's part of prioritization. I think the key thing is the things that you, it's not so much that you let them slip, but you make a conscious decision to deprioritize them. And that you clearly communicate that to the people involved that this is not something I can work on right now. I haven't always been good at that myself, but it's something I want to be good at. Yeah. So yeah, when you're talking about like flaking and stuff like that, I thought maybe that's what you're talking about. I was like, no, I'm not, I'm very bad at that kind of stuff. But in terms of like things like, yeah, paper reading groups and stuff like that, I think part of it is like, like, I guess there's like some aspect of it that's more like, um, forcing myself to like, have some accountability, I guess, or something like that. Whereas like, how do you do that? Paper reading group, there are people there, you know, I'm, you know, there's some expectation to have something for them. So it was that, I think there's kind of that sort of aspect of things. So by publicly stating this is going to happen, you're requiring yourself to follow through. Exactly. I think that's kind of what happens. I've got another hypothesis that I think might be related, which is, I think, well, I mean, clearly you're somebody who just genuinely loves learning. And I am as well, you know, I really very much am, but I'm not sure, like, it's that common to love learning as much as we do, you know, like I, there's almost nothing I, I mean, I would rather spend time with my daughter than anything else. But other than that, like that's the, I just want to learn things. And I guess when that gives you a lot of joy, you put time into it. Yeah. I think there's certainly some of that, but in terms of like, yeah, I think a lot of, I think a lot of it, like in terms of the paper reading group, yes, I was like, I'm always like, yeah, that was, that's an example of where like, well, I think the thing was like, especially I created like the paper reading group, like someone was like, maybe you should have a diffusion model paper. That's so, yeah, just to explain, it's like, again, a paper reading group that I am hosting like every week. And it's about these sorts of image generation models, you know, that they're called diffusion models is like the main model. This is the new throwing letter, not those old fashioned cycle GANs some people still talk about. Exactly. So I had, someone was saying, yeah, we should have this study group. And I was like, sure, I'll do it. And the reason I decided to do it was because I felt like this is a good way to force me to actually read a lot of these papers. And otherwise, it is tough to read, you know, papers in, you know, when there's so many, you know, there's so much to do. And there's just a lot, a lot, you know, there's, you know, and there's so many papers to read. So I figured, you know, this is this is just a good opportunity to kind of force myself to dig into the literature more. So I think part of it was just like, yeah, just giving, you know, kind of, you know, making these situations where I'm forced to, you know, have this public accountability and get the work done. And so like, that's what like, just generally in terms of like, you know, research and stuff like that, too. Like I have often meetings with my professors, with my advisor, Dr. Lemonson, you know, I have like a meeting at least once a week, sometimes twice or even three times a week. Because, you know, then it's like some form of accountability, like, okay, I have to have something to show to my advisor. And so I'll have, so I'll, you know, be able to do some experiments and show that. So it's just really helpful. And especially as I'm the kind of person that tends to procrastinate a lot, actually, and I don't think people realize that. It's actually, you know, I tend to, I am, you know, it's so funny, because like, It's interesting you say that, because like, I feel the same way about myself. And yet I'm somebody who like, is on the other end of this, almost this exact question, which is people often like, how do you get so much work done? And I always think like, That question people ask me, too. And I'm like, like, I've gotten this question asked many, you know, several times. And I'm like, I cannot, I don't, honestly, I'm surprised I'm able to do this as well. Like, I probably shouldn't be asking you the question that I can never answer for myself. It's like, it's like, I'm always telling people, like, how, I don't, like, if I was, if I were better at time management and stuff like that, I probably would accomplish so much more. So it's like, so there's definitely that aspect of things. So like, you know, also having that accountability definitely helps, like, at least it will get done. And I'm still going to probably procrastinate on it a bit. So like, even like a lot of these, you know, this paper reading group, I'm like, preparing it, like the night before. And so like, I'm, so the thing is, like, Yeah, I meant to be presenting it tomorrow's paper reading group, and I have not prepared anything at this point. Maybe we should use some time to do so. Helping it. Yeah, but the thing is, like, I've noticed, like, I think I realized, like, okay, so like, I tend to, like, I do realize I tend to have like a faster comprehension in terms of like, I can read some paper and like, understand it fairly quickly. And I know a lot of people tend to struggle with that. And like, like a lot of things I can read, I mean, read it, and I can, you know, understand it very quickly. And so that's how like, like, even with my procrastination, I'm somehow able to manage it's not it's not the best situation to be in, to be honest, but like, somehow able to, you know, I've managed because like, I can still pick up like, so I think if in terms of like, like, overall, so like, I'd overall tell people like, that what I tell is like, I'm certainly like, I will admit that, you know, I'm kind of above average, right? Is it some something that, you know, I will say I'm, I'm not the kind of person who likes to brag about these sorts of things. But I will admit, like, you know, maybe I'm, you know, I'm somewhat above average, of course. And I think that when I'm the what the main one, of course, I think the main things that I'm, I'm pretty good at would be things like memory, in terms of like, quickly memorizing stuff and comprehension. So I think those two things really help in terms of this sort of quick learning and, you know, these sorts of stuff. But then I'd also say like, before I move on from the topic of, you know, being above average or whatever, I think a lot of what I've been able to do is, of course, through hard work. And I think this goes back to your point about work ethic and stuff like this. You know, the only way I've reached this level is mostly through hard work. I don't, I don't think this would be possible if I was just, you know, if I didn't put any hard work into it. It's like a combination of, you know, definitely having some of those talents, but then also putting in a lot of hard work and a lot of, you know, sweat and blood and tears into this and, you know, you know, working at it for, you know, a long, long time. And so that's definitely that sort of work ethic is definitely something. I mean, the tenacity seems critical, you know, Andrea. Yeah, I, yeah, I think so. I think, yeah, so I think also that's something I've, you know, definitely learned from, you know, my parents. And I think they've kind of brought me up in that sort of, you know, those sorts of values in terms of hard work and like, you know, never taking these sorts of things, you know, these sorts of talents for granted and, you know, putting in the hard work that is necessary. So that's everything like people like, oh, you must be, you're still smart and everything must come easy to you. There's certainly some aspect that, you know, there's some comprehensive stuff that does come easy, but a lot of it is still hard work that I have to still put effort into. So it's not like everything comes easy to me just, you know, you know, automatically. There's still some aspect that, you know, there's a lot of work that goes into it. Yeah, that's like something like that's sometimes kind of, you know, irritates me. Oh, you're, you know, everything must be so easy for you. And it's like, no, it's not. It's like, yeah, exactly. Yeah. You know, in certain aspects, I'm still, you know, like, there's still like work you have to do. It's like, it's not like you can avoid doing this stuff. You just can't avoid, right? You have to like put in the effort to, to finish your homework problems, to, to, you know, write your essays, to, you know, whatever projects you're working on, you still have to put in the effort. And so I know that's, that's something that I... And like, even though like, okay, for you, you're saying you, you seem to pick it up a bit faster than other people, but you're still starting with something that you didn't previously know. And at first you don't understand, and then you have to struggle through and develop that understanding and then practice. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, I say like, even picking it up quickly. I mean, that's just to say, like, I can pick up, you know, you know, the first, like, let's say if your best comprehension of the material is 100%, you can pick up maybe the first, you know, 70%. I can pick that up pretty quickly. But then, you know, to get that remaining 30% in, you still have to put in, put in the work, right? So it's more of like, you know, I definitely am able to get a kind of a general gist and grasp of what's going on in a particular field or a particular paper or whatever. But obviously, if you want to, you know, truly understand it, you do have to put in more work. So like, you know, especially with this field of like diffusion models and stuff, you know, you know, I've been, even some of the original papers, I still go back and read, like, I mean, I understand the general gist, but there's still certain aspects that you want to like, really, you know, fully understand that those papers, like to fully understand that field, you know, there's still certain parts that I still am studying. And then of course, there's other aspects of it in terms of putting into practice, like, you know, in the case of these models, and these sorts of deep learning in general, you have to code it up, and you have to actually experiment and try it out. And so, you know, there's also that aspect of things that also helps solidify your knowledge. And there's really no way around that instead of except you have to do that. So there's no way around those sorts of things. And you know, that provides, you know, these sort of different knowledge that you can't get anywhere else. You have to do the code. Yeah, it is. It is. It's hard work. And it's difficult. And like, I feel like that's the biggest difference I see between people I know that are extremely effective and those who are less effective is the people who keep doing it. Like for me personally, I actually don't find I pick things up faster than most people, but I seem to stick with things longer than most people. And I also seem to be more like prepared to keep digging and digging. You know, it's like yesterday when we were chatting in our little study group, and I asked about a paper that actually is extremely basic. And I was like, I don't think I fully understand this yet. And I probably ought to. And yeah, just really took the time to get it, dig through it, which in some ways requires putting aside the embarrassment of saying like, I don't fully understand this fairly basic paper. Yeah. But now I feel like I probably understand it better than a lot of people do, having taken that time with you guys to dig into it carefully. And going back into like, yeah, like understanding stuff, like obviously, of course, teaching this material really, like, I guess it's like the Feynman technique, right? The Feynman technique is, you know, try to teach it to other people and make, and that also really helps. So like, especially with this sort of diffusion model stuff, like, you know, I've just been practicing in so many different ways, right? Just through that, in terms of teaching this material through the study group, through like the study group that I host. And then of course, you know, the sort of study groups that we have together. And then. Yeah. Well, that's what we were saying yesterday when we were chatting in our group, it's like, we're learning ourselves diffusion modeling through diffusion processes of like doing it again and again in a thousand different ways until eventually it makes its way into our brain. Yeah. And so, you know, I have that, you know, that study group, these two study groups, then, you know, you know, the sort of, you know, writing it out in code and teaching, try to teach it in a different way, not just like from the paper, but from the code. And then like, also like, I recently had this Twitter thread and it's like, you know, that's a, that was a different experience. It's like, how do I teach it in a, you know, in those limitations of Twitter, it's like an entirely different kind of thought process. So, and then I know I've just kind of written down, you know, in just different ways of explaining the same concept, you know, because I kind of actually really want to, you know, you know, understand diffusion models and kind of be actually an expert in that field, to be honest. So I just, I've been kind of like really diving deep in that for, you know, I've been doing that for several months now and through all of these different, you know, platforms. So I think like, so like overall teaching is something that actually in general, I'm kind of passionate about. And it's, but it's something like, I don't know, like, again, how good I am at it. It's something that I feel like I'm still trying to, you know, get better at, especially, I think we, you know, we've talked about this before. It's like something that, you know, I, you know, myself, I'm the person kind of like, you know, being the kind of person who grasps things fairly quickly, or again, as I talked about grasp, you know, the first 70, 80% fairly quickly and kind of gets to that level quickly compared to other people. It's harder for me to like figure out like what exactly are the, the weak points or the sort of, you know. That makes teaching more difficult for you than other people, I would say. So that's something that, you know, can be tough. But again, I try to get a lot of extra real feedback when talking about these sort of things to figure that out. But that's something, but like, I really enjoy teaching. And you know, that's another thing, like, that's another thing, like going back to, I keep changing topics here, but like going back to like, you know, careers and things like academia and stuff like that, right? Like academia is another great opportunity to like, you know, it's a good, it is a good opportunity to teach and also... I mean, it should be ideal, right? It's like it's teaching and doing research, but sadly, the structure of academia is a bit of a nightmare. Yeah, it turns out like, academia is weird because like, it's teaching and research, but the environment doesn't, or like the sort of, you know, bureaucratic processes or administration does not, or like, whatever it is, it does not select for the best teachers and researchers, right? It's, it's, it mostly selects for like, the best researchers, but of course, those are like the, when you say best researchers, they're still like, the researchers who get the most grants or whatever, they still like, you know, there's still probably lots of great researchers who are able to get those opportunities and stuff. Anyway, that's kind of a whole diversion. But like, in terms of like, even academia, I've had very bad professors, but then they're like, amazing researchers in terms of like, they've got a lot of grants, and they've got a lot of papers and stuff. And that's the reason they, they're stuck, they stick around at these universities, and they get, you know, high pay from these universities, it's because they're good, you know, they have good research labs, but they are terrible at teaching. But unfortunately, and unfortunately, some of them just don't care about improving their quality of teaching. But I think that even academia, you do have at least, like, if for someone who's interested in both teaching and research, it does seem like a like a good place to be in. And so that's why like, even, even though I do know of a lot of disadvantages of academia, I think there's also still some advantages for the sorts of things that I'm interested in, you know, that being teaching and research. So that's why I'm still, you know, highly considering that as a potential pathway. But yeah, I'm just overall, like, also really excited about teaching and educational content. And I'm hoping I'm doing, I'm doing, yeah, I hope it's going well and people are getting started. I mean, teaching is itself a whole, you know, research field that one can study. And there's a lot of valuable research on to how people learn and what teaching works well. And yeah, it's a really interesting field. And I've mainly been studying it, well, mainly been studying it for teaching my daughter, but I started a little bit before the fast AI courses, but not nearly as much as I do now. Yeah. I mean, I definitely think the fast AI approach of like the sort of top down. Suddenly I can't hear you. Oh, now you're back. Oh, sorry. Did something happen? Yeah, just your top, just have disappeared for five seconds. Okay. Anyway, I was just saying, yeah, I was saying that, like, I think that I definitely think like the fast AI approach of this top down and followed by the bottom up is really like a very, yeah, I don't know. It's a very good approach, I think. And I like it. Sorry? I like it. Yeah. And I think like any sort of like a material that, I mean, yeah, it's just like, yeah, it's definitely a hard thing to do, like as a teacher, right? It's like hard to prepare that sort of material. As a teacher, you kind of think about it from like, you want to start from the foundations and work your way up. And it's kind of hard to, you know, like change that kind of. Also, we haven't seen many role models of teaching technical content top down. So we haven't experienced what that looks like very often. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, you know, and, and, and, but yeah, I mean, it definitely does say something that like someone like me, who generally does start from the sort of bottom up approach and, you know, does fairly well with that bottom up approach. And even then I'm getting a lot out of the sort of top down approach. So I think it's also like, it's not, you know, I mean, yeah. I know a lot of, yeah, a lot of people, you know, struggle with the bottom up approach. And that's why I do it. Yeah. Even as someone who does well with the bottom up approach, I think even then the top down approach is, is very helpful. Oh, that's really cool. So that's, yeah. I don't know where I was going with this, to be honest. That's fine. I'm very interested in your thoughts. Yeah. All right. I think we should consider wrapping things up, depending on like, whether there's things, either life things or work things or thoughts you have that we haven't covered and you're interested in chatting about. I don't know. That thing comes to mind, I guess. Yeah. I mean, I don't know, like, yeah, whether, I'm sorry, or I just, I just, maybe there were other maybe misconceptions about child prodigies. Oh, I would love to hear about that if the, yeah. Well, I know, I know we've discussed this before in terms of like, you know, we, this is again, kind of random, like we discussed it before, but like child prodigies, they tend to be, I mean, of course, again, even in this interview, we talked a little bit about like, you know, child prodigies tend to be, you know, sort of considered socially outcast, things like that. And we talked about that, but then also like, you know, things like, you know, they tend to be considered, oh, maybe they're autistic and those sorts of aspects of things. And I mean, I just, it's kind of like, I mean, I tell this to people, like, even in other interviews and in other places and when people ask me, it's like, yeah, I think I'm fairly normal. Right. I think you're fairly normal. Yeah. Whatever it's the, yeah. And I mean, we've had literally that with our daughter sometimes, not that often, not that unusually, people literally ask like, oh, does she have some, like, oh, she's quite advanced at school. Oh, does she have social problems? Yeah. No. And they don't even let, they don't even almost seem to believe me. They keep talking as if she has just because she's doing well at school. I mean, there's like, I think some, you know, research into like, you know, yeah, the sort of coincidence, like, yeah, the sort of thing where like, you know, both, you know, people who are smart and, you know, they tend to have autism and these sorts of things. True E is the term that tends to get used, twice exceptional. Oh, okay. Yeah. And so there's that, so then I think, yeah, there's. There is some correlation, but it's nowhere near a hundred percent, you know. Yeah, exactly. If I remember correctly, at one point, like someone was like, I think there's like some research and they're like, so where was I? Oh yeah, I was saying like, I think at one point, like there was some folks who were interested, I think researchers in talking to us and things like that and studying us, but then they like, then they heard we're not autistic or something like this. And they're like, oh, we're not interested in Bulgar. I think they were interested in more studying the autistic part of things. And so, yeah, I mean, there's just generally the sort of like, I think just overall sort of stereotypes about how a prodigy is. And, you know, hopefully, as I've lived my life, I think I kind of had, went against those stereotypes and hopefully. Yeah. Well, I mean, stereotypes are a lazy cognitive shortcut, you know, so it's very tempting and easy for people to put people into a bucket and then assign a whole bunch of things to them based on assumed group characteristics. But yeah, that prejudice is never good because no groups of humans are, you know, so identical. Hopefully these sorts of experiences that people see and hopefully, I mean, yeah, as you said, like, yeah, people are very complex and diverse and it's not, you know, the stereotypes are not always applicable. And so, yeah, I think people should be more open to that. Yeah. And then just generally, I think I was just gonna make some general points of like, yeah, obviously, like we mentioned this before, you know, hard work is always important. And then, of course, at least I'm the type of person who's very goal oriented. I don't know if that works for everyone, but for me, I've always thought it's useful to have a goal in mind and, you know, work towards that goal. At least that's how it's worked for me. And honestly, I recommend people to at least explore that as something to try out. And then, yeah. And yeah, I mean, of course, I'm very lucky, of course, to have this very supportive family. And I guess if there's any any parents or any folks like that who are listening, I just would recommend to, you know, keep, you know, try, you know, whatever you can do to, you know, support your children, because you never know what could come out of it. And more specifically, I think, like, I would say support your children in terms of what they're telling you they want rather than what you think they ought to want. Yeah, I was gonna say, like, don't push them in terms of like, yeah, like, I was never pushed, which is a good thing. Honestly, it's, I forgot to mention this, but like, there are many times when my parents were like, maybe you're pushing yourself too much. And it's like, honestly, there's also that aspect of things like also, you know, there's also needs to be sometimes trying to have those breaks, I guess, which is like, which, you know, in this case, my parents are the ones who kind of provide that, I think. If anything, yeah, they never really pushed me and everything. They were like, if anything, they, they want me to slow down a bit, I think. So I think, yeah, you don't want to push your in what yet children, yeah, never really should be pushed, but they should be supported in what they're interested in, and what they're passionate about. And of course, like what you're passionate about, interested can change over time. But you know, just kind of whatever it is, it's worth supporting it. And so luckily, you know, I've, I've had all of that, thanks to my parents and my family. You know, so I mean, not, yeah, not just my parents, of course, even my sister, you know, was supportive, you know, comes along to, to, to all these classes and waits there and things like that. And, you know, even I'm, I try to be supportive with her, go to all of her performances and things like that. So, you know, that's also good that we were lucky to have that sort of family unit that's very supportive of each other. Yeah. So, yeah. So yeah, mainly it. And of course, if you're interested in following me, you like follow me on Twitter and stuff. I'm, you know, I'm mostly on Twitter and I, you know, we'll see. I plan to, I'm interested in maybe expanding from just Twitter, you know, for, for various reasons. I bet. But, but I mean, I really love Twitter as a platform in general and I've met a lot of amazing people there. So, I want to stick on, you know, stick to Twitter as much as possible, but also I think some diversification is still also good in general, right? Like, you know, they say that about like finance and they said about a lot of things, you know, being diversified. And so I think that's probably also true in terms of my, my social media and my personal brand probably. Yeah. Well, Tanishq, this has been an absolute pleasure and absolutely fascinating. And I feel very, very privileged to have you as our first guest on this podcast, this amazing story and such thoughtful comments. I'm really grateful. And at all this time, so late at night, thank you so much. Yeah. I don't know if people, if people are watching, don't realize that I'm, I tend to be a night owl. So this is totally fine for me. What is the time for you now? It is, let's see. Well, it's, it's right now, three o'clock, but. Three o'clock in the morning. Okay. Well, yeah. It's not, it's not too bad. It isn't. Oh, totally fine. Yeah. But yeah, I'm, I've just, you know, this was a great experience and I'm extremely honored to also be your first guest. I think that's, it's interesting to, it's, yeah, it's an honor to kind of start you out with this, with this new podcast and I'm sure this podcast will be, you know, extremely successful. So I'm, yeah, I'm kind of honored to be that, the first guest. Let's cross you out. Thanks, mate. Awesome. Appreciate it. Okay. Thank you.
