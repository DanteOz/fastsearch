{"text": " So we're going to talk about algorithmic bias in the first half of class, and then we'll get into the transformer architecture after that. And my plan with this is to offer some different case studies around bias. Not all of them are NLP related, but I've added additional NLP examples. This is an important topic. Debunk some common misconceptions and also offer this kind of system for classifying types of bias, which can be useful and then towards the end, I'll get into some steps towards addressing bias. But this is a very important and relevant issue that you'll be seeing as you start your first jobs as data scientist. So good to know that algorithms can encode and magnify human bias, and this is one of the things that worries me about machine learning, even though there's a lot that I love about machine learning. And so I'm going to go through a few case studies. The first is facial recognition and predictive policing. And also as usual, feel free to stop me if you have questions as I go. So this is a research by Joy Balamwini and Timnit Gebru that came out last year, that evaluated commercial computer vision products from IBM, Microsoft, and Face++, which is a large Chinese company. And it found that these products performed worse on women than on men and worse on people with dark skin compared to people with light skin. And then there was also this kind of intersectional effect where it was worst of all on dark skinned women. So to give one example, IBM's product was 99.7 percent accurate on light skinned men, and only 65.3 percent accurate on dark skinned women. And again, this was a commercial product that was released, and that's a horrifying difference in accuracy. To have between those two groups. So they did a follow-up study, Joy Balamwini and Deb Rajee looking at a new set of companies and found that Amazon has the same problem. And this is particularly concerning as, actually I should say first, there was a separate study by the ACLU that looked at the technology Amazon is selling to police departments and found that it misidentified 28 Congress people as criminals. And this disproportionately included people of color in the ones that were being misidentified as criminals. And this technology is already in use and it's almost completely unregulated in the US. So there's really kind of no oversight or accountability of how it's being used or what its accuracy is. And I'll talk more about that there's this risk of runaway feedback loops and predictive policing that's been documented and studied. It's not just Amazon, IBM is also selling predictive policing technology as is Palantir and other companies. So there's a city in California using IBM Watson dashboard for predictive policing and a city official there said, with machine learning, with automation, there's a 99 percent success. So that robot will be 99 percent accurate in telling us what's going to happen next. This is completely false. This is a common misconception though that people have about machine learning. And it's really important to keep in mind as you're building machine learning products, to know that users often think that computers are more accurate and more, more objective than they are. And it's in this case, it's very horrifying that kind of a city official using this has this misconception. So algorithmic bias, as you know well, computers make mistakes and unjust algorithmic bias is one of those mistakes. Machine learning involves algorithms learning from data that data is often biased. And algorithmic systems are disproportionately being used on the poor. So there's kind of a difference in who's feeling the impact of when there is bias and inaccuracy. Cathy O'Neill has written a great book. Cathy O'Neill is a fellow math PhD. She wrote Weapons of Math Destruction. Goes through a number of case studies of kind of how algorithmic systems are being used in different sectors such as hiring, firing, education, criminal justice system. So statistical bias is a kind of technical term. The difference between the statistics expected value and the true value. Unjust bias is a disproportionate preference for or prejudice against a group. Today when I'm talking about bias, I'll primarily be talking about unjust bias, not the statistical term. And then also talk a little bit about unconscious bias, which are biases that we don't realize we have. Sometimes people are confused that there's also a thing in our neural networks called the bias. Yes. So bias is also, which is kind of related though to statistical bias because basically when you have that difference, that's what you're trying to learn. But yes, when you're learning the weights and the bias in a neural network, that's kind of basically like the multiplier and the constant. But again, here I'll be focusing on unjust bias. So there was a paper I really liked earlier this year by Harini Suresh and John Guttag, that identified that different sources of bias have different causes and they kind of come into play at different points in the pipeline of generating data, selecting a population, making measurements, training a model, deploying that. And it's really helpful to kind of have a little bit more of a framework around this because as we'll get into later, bias can be a very kind of generic term and sometimes it's too generic to be useful. And so this will kind of give us a way to identify different types and their causes. And so returning to gender shades, this is an example of representation bias where kind of the data set was not representative of the people that might, the algorithm might be used on later. And it's also an example of evaluation bias. And so here, so in machine learning in general, benchmark data sets spur on a lot of research. And so in some ways they're great, they lead to a lot of progress in the field. But if there are biases in benchmark data sets, they can really be kind of propagated at scale when everyone's studying the same few data sets. And so part of kind of why all these companies had issues of bias in their facial recognition is that a lot of the kind of major facial recognition data sets had very few dark-skinned women in them. And so for instance, IGBA, as of a few years ago, only 4% of the pictures in it were dark-skinned women. Another example is ImageNet. There is a great paper from Shreyar Shankar et al in 2017 highlighting that two-thirds of ImageNet images are from the West. And I think ImageNet is probably by far the most well-studied computer vision data set. And so this is the breakdown. Yellow is the US. That's 45% of the images. Great Britain had 7.6% of the images. 6% were from Italy, 3% from Canada, 2.8% from Australia, 2.5% from Spain. And so we've covered like two-thirds of this pie and haven't gone outside the West. And so this has shown up in kind of several ways. For instance, bridegroom. So a man getting married is one of the categories in ImageNet. And Shreyar Shankar found that it can't. Classifiers trained on ImageNet don't recognize bridegrooms from India, Pakistan, kind of Egypt, places outside the West. There was also, I meant to update this, a paper that just came out in the last few weeks from Facebook, where they looked at household items like toothpaste or soap around the world, and again found that the error rates were higher outside the West. And so I think this is something we'll probably continue to see implications from, just because it's been such a widely used and widely studied data set. So one step towards trying to address this is to create more representative data sets. And this is what Joy Balanwini did as part of her research. And she used pictures of politicians from countries around the world to make a more diverse and more representative data set. And then I need to credit Deb Rajee, who is a collaborator with Joy Balanwini on the Amazon research for bringing up this point in the talk I saw her give two weeks ago. She really emphasized, though, that when you're creating a more diverse data set, really when you're creating any data set, it's important to keep in mind issues of consent, exploitation, and privacy. Because basically after this research came out, IBM said, OK, we'll make a more diverse data set. And they scraped a bunch of photos from Flickr without getting people's consent beforehand, which is not a good solution. And there are other issues with China is currently partnered with Zimbabwe to get more images of black faces, but in a way that's not really taking into account the consent of citizens of Zimbabwe. So there can be, I guess, a tension between this of getting representative sets, but in a way that is not exploitative. So the second case study I want to look at is recidivism algorithms used in prison sentencing. So ProPublica did an investigation that came out in 2016 on the Compass recidivism algorithm. And this is software sold by a private company that's used in the criminal justice system, and it's used at several points in the criminal justice system. So it can be used in determining who needs to pay parole, or sorry, pay bail. And this is before someone's even had a trial. In the US, I believe half a million people are currently in prison because they're too poor to afford bail, and this is before they've even had a trial. The software can be used in determining sentencing decisions and parole decisions. So something having a huge, huge impact on people's lives. And ProPublica found that the false positive rate, so that people that were incorrectly labeled as being at a high risk of committing another crime but did not, was 45% for black defendants, which is really, really high false positive rate. Again, this is for a commercial product that's widely in use, impacting people's lives. And to contrast that, the false positive rate for white defendants was 23.5%. So this is a huge difference kind of between the groups. There was research from Dartmouth last year that showed that this software is no more accurate than mechanical Turk workers. So random people on the internet are as good at guessing if someone's going to commit another crime as this software. They also compared, so the Compass Recidivism algorithm is a black box with 137 inputs. It's kind of protected as proprietary content, how it works. And it was not any more accurate than, I think, a linear classifier on three variables. So that's pretty horrifying, and it's still in use. One place that was challenged was Wisconsin, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld its use. And this relates to different definitions of fairness, which is kind of outside the scope of the talk for today. But Arvind Narayan, who's a Princeton professor, has a great talk, 21 Definitions of Fairness, that gets into this more. And I'll just say while there are different definitions of fairness, I don't know of anybody outside of the company that creates the Compass Recidivism algorithm that thinks that the definition they're using is a particularly good one or one that maps to kind of our notions of fairness. So a key point that I want to emphasize, and this kind of I see people make this mistake a lot in the media, is that even when race and gender are not inputs, your algorithm can still be biased, because machine learning, basically the whole purpose of machine learning is to find latent variables. And so even if you're not explicitly recording race or gender, they're latently encoded in a bunch of other variables, and so you can still end up with biased algorithms. And this is kind of a common misconception. You'll hear kind of tech executives saying, well, I don't have to worry about bias, because we're not looking at race, or we're not looking at gender. You do still need to be concerned. And in the case of the Compass Recidivism algorithm, race was not an input. So it's kind of ending up with these very biased results without using race as an explicit input. Another reason to be worried is that machine learning can amplify bias. So it's not just that it's encoding kind of existing bias, but in some cases, it's amplifying it. There are two studies that I like on this. One was looking at a data set of kind of images of people doing different things. And in the data set, 67% of the people cooking are women. And so the algorithm ends up learning to predict that if someone's cooking, it's probably a woman at a rate of 84%. So kind of giving more biased outputs than what was seen in the training data. And this was written about in Wired, the study. Another one, Bias and Bios, by Maria de Artiga et al., they looked at predicting people's job titles based off of their LinkedIn description. And again, they found this kind of mechanism under which bias was compounded. So in their data set, only 14% of the surgeons were women. And they ended up with predictions in which only 11% of the true positives were women for surgeons. And so basically, kind of there's differences in errors of kind of who's having false positives versus false negatives of like what kind of error you get where bias is compounded. So returning to this idea of there being different types of bias and kind of like what's the root cause of this bias. This is an example of historical bias. Historical bias is a fundamental structural issue with the first step of the data generation process and can exist even given perfect sampling and feature selection. So this is something where the Compass recidivism algorithm is probably not going to be fixed by taking a different underlying data set of kind of criminal justice history in the US. That's not going to solve it. One step towards doing better is to try to talk to domain experts and those impacted. And this is good advice for any sort of application you're working on. And so an example of it comes from Christian Lum, who is a statistician at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group. And she organized a workshop at the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in a MAL conference last year. And she partnered with Elizabeth Bender, who's a former public defender and an attorney for New York's Legal Aid Society, as well as Terrence Wilkerson, who's an innocent man who was arrested and could not afford bail. And he was also kind of given a high risk rating by the Compass recidivism algorithm. And this is available online. You can watch this tutorial. But it really gives a lot of insight of things I wouldn't know about how the criminal justice system works in practice. Because we kind of make these computer programs often in a more abstract, nicely isolated environment. And then they're kind of plugged into these really messy real world systems. And it's important to understand those and to understand the impact. For instance, Elizabeth Bender shares that to visit a client on Rikers Island, which is where Terrence Wilkerson was held pre-trial, the attorney is having to travel two hours each way by bus to only get 30 minutes with the client. And that's assuming the guards even bring him in on time. There are kind of a lot of things that make this really difficult in practice that are important to know about for anyone designing these systems. I'm only going to drink a water. And actually, I should check any questions so far. The third case study I wanted to look at is online ad delivery. This is a really important one since ads kind of power so much of the internet and so many of the major tech companies. So Latonya Sweeney is a professor at Harvard and director of their data privacy lab. And she noticed several years ago that when she Googled her name, she would get these search results or get ads that say, Latonya Sweeney arrested, kind of implying that she had an arrest record. And this is from a company that does background checks. And Latonya Sweeney is the only person with her name in the US. She does not have an arrest record. She paid the $50 to do the background check and found it says she has zero arrest. But she tried Googling some other names and noticed that some of the ads were a lot more neutral. So Kristin Lindquist got these ads that say, we found Kristin Lindquist, even though Kristin Lindquist has three arrests if you pay for the background check. And there's this very misleading element. And being a computer scientist, Latonya Sweeney studied this in a very systematic way. She looked at over 2,000 names. These are all images from her paper. She did Google image searches and saw these are the images returned for Latonya versus the images returned for Kristin and then kind of confirmed this with over 2,000 names that black names were more likely to return these ad results suggesting that the person had been arrested, regardless of whether they had. And white names returned more neutral ads, just saying, we found so and so. And this is something that could have had a kind of a direct impact on people's chances getting hired for something if an employer is searching for someone and doesn't want to pay for the background check. Or maybe doesn't even consciously register that they saw this ad suggesting that someone was perhaps arrested. That could still kind of influence how they saw the person. And it's also kind of wrong from a representational, this is what Kate Crawford calls a representational harm to suggest that there's this relationship between a black name and criminality. And this was covered in the MIT Tech Review. So that's a problem with online ads. There are a number of other problems. So we've seen stories over the past few years of people placing Facebook ads saying, I only want young people to see this job ad. Also housing ads saying, I don't want black or Latino people to see this housing ad. This is something, so these were all ProPublica investigations. ProPublica pointed the housing ad issue out in 2016. And I want to note that these seem like violations of a lot of our civil rights laws in the US. So we have laws against employment discrimination based on age and housing discrimination based on race. Facebook was still doing it over a year after it had first been pointed out. So ProPublica went back in 2017 and saw it was still the case. There was a settlement earlier this year in March that Facebook, and we'll see if things change since they've promised to change before, saying that it was going to try to address this again. So that was in March. In April, new research came out showing that even when the advertiser is not trying to discriminate, Facebook serves up a very skewed audience. And so the authors of the study said even a well-meaning advertiser might end up reaching a mostly white and or mostly male audience. That's because Facebook's opaque algorithms trained on historically biased data predict that those people will be most interested. And so in the study, they had job ads that they placed that they didn't specify who they wanted it to be shown to that were either shown to 90 percent men or were shown to 90 percent women based on the job ad. Similar with housing ads, they had housing ads that were shown to 90 percent white people. They varied, for instance, based on what picture was used with the housing ad led to these very skewed results. And I should I guess going back to the Latonya Sweeney case of the background check ads being very different, what the background check company claimed is that they were placing basically two versions of the ad for each name. And Google lets you kind of A-B test, which ads are most effective. And the company says that people were clicking on the ads suggesting that people with black names had been arrested at higher rates and clicking on the neutral ads for white people. And that's where this bias came in. So just kind of different different mechanisms that can result in this. And so I want to I want to highlight here that several kind of several of these issues we're talking about the criminal justice system, policing, housing, jobs. There was also you probably saw the article, I guess, last year about Amazon having developed an internal recruiting tool to screen resumes and it learned to penalize resumes that had the word women's in it. For instance, if someone had been on a women's sports team or gone to a women's college that was penalized. And these are all kind of civil rights issues. And many ethics, A.I. ethics concerns are about human rights or civil rights. There is a great article by Dominique Harrison of the Aspen Institute highlighting kind of how technological changes are eroding civil rights in many areas in the U.S. or at least contributing to them. So in thinking about I think often people think like it's going to be impossible to regulate tech because it's kind of such a big and complex industry. I really like the framing from a Neil Dash of a few years ago saying there's no technology industry anymore. The label is too big to be useful. Tech is being used in every industry. And so I think we need to think about kind of what human rights and what civil rights we want to protect, particularly in areas of housing, education, employment, criminal justice, medical care, voting and so on. And I need to credit Frederike Kalkner who's a researcher at Privacy International who I think did a good job of kind of like articulating this framing. So we need to safeguard human rights with thoughtful laws. So now I want to give some examples of bias in NLP. So yesterday or not yesterday, Tuesday it was great to have Nikhil come and speak on his work of stereotypes and word embeddings over history. So I want to talk a little bit about this is one of the papers he cited, Eileen Kaliskin, Joanna Bryson and Arvind Niranjan paper. And what they did in this paper is they looked at, they called them I think little baskets of words. And so for instance, this and these are not complete, I ran out of space, but they would have kind of 20 flowers or 20 insects. They had pleasant words and unpleasant words. And so for instance here they found that the flowers were closer to the pleasant words and the insects were closer to the unpleasant words, which is not shocking. And this is on, I can't remember if it's Word2Vec or GloVe, but you know on these trained word embeddings. But then they tested on things like white names and black names and they found that white names were closer to the pleasant words and black names were closer to the unpleasant words, which is very concerning. And they went through something I like about this paper is they kind of went through a variety of papers from psychology and sociology that had looked at different kind of documented biases and basically found that they were all present in word embeddings as well. So it's a good example of kind of, I think, drawing from interdisciplinary research to kind of confirm these underlying biases that have already been observed and studied in other fields. So a few kind of papers I recommend on this topic. So there's the original Bollock-Bosse paper that used more the style of analogies to look at biases in word embeddings. And that came out, so that was 2016 as was the next one, looking at the baskets of words. And I mentioned this a little bit during the Kiehl's talk, but the Bollock-Bosse paper had proposed de-biasing word embeddings and the Kaliskin paper proposed that the de-biasing should happen at the time of action. I think that's kind of an interesting point to keep in mind of these, you know, where should we address this? And then there's the Kiehl's paper that we got to hear about in a lot more detail on Tuesday. And then this paper by Hillelgonen and Joab Goldberg, which just came out earlier this year that showed that de-biasing methods cover up systemic bias, but they do not remove them, which I thought was kind of interesting continuation. But this is still, I think, an area with plenty of potential for research that hasn't been settled. Jeremy brought up a good point on Tuesday about how now with kind of pre-trained language models, the bias is going to be present but in more complex ways when you don't just have linear embeddings. Yes? Yeah, I was wondering if most of this work has been done in English or is this specifically great in confidence? That's a great question. So yeah, the question was, has this mostly been done in English? To my knowledge, yes. I think that this has been done in English. And I have heard people kind of raise the warning that, yeah, like the biases we hear about are typically from English and there's a risk that, I mean, kind of I would say a high likelihood that there can be a lot of biases in other languages that aren't getting the attention or study that English is. Particularly as kind of many tech platforms are offering services in other languages and translation to other languages, but often without that much support or as many people on their teams who are native speakers of the language. So the impact of bias in word embeddings is kind of bias in Google Translate. Google Translate has changed this if you only enter a single sentence, but if you enter both the sentences, you do still get a biased response, which was surprising to me. So this is still what you would get for translating, he is a doc, or so you can also do it where you start with she is a doctor, he is a nurse, translate to Turkish, and then back to English and it comes back with the genders flipped. Rob Spear had a blog post two years ago where he talked about a system for restaurant reviews and it ranked Mexican restaurants lower because the word embeddings had learned negative connotations with the word Mexican. So word embeddings improve web search results, so we can see a lot of risk of what if searching for grad student neural networks was more likely to return male names. This is about automatic speech recognition is what ASR is, and this was a talk, I don't know if you guys have met David Guy Breeson, he taught in this program I guess two years ago and then ended up switching to the computer science department here at USF, but this is his area of study and I searched for the original of this image and I could not find it, but it's looking at speech recognition just from different regions within the UK. This is pretty neat because it's I don't know at least 15 different regions, and here the green is correct, red is incorrect, so it's showing kind of the accuracy to error, and you can see there's huge variation for like this region, just a tiny amount of red, it's mostly green, other regions, I mean this is less than 50% accurate, there's a huge amount of variation in speech recognition performance. David highlighted in his talk at the time that speech recognition struggles with accents, different dialects of a language, children and elderly people as well, often their voices sound different and speech recognition is less accurate. There was a paper in HBR earlier this year saying voice recognition still has significant race and gender biases. Here's an article from Wired, voice is the next big platform unless you have an accent, so in the and we haven't really covered speech in this class, but it's an area of NLP and an area where there is a lot of kind of risk for bias and products working more poorly for different groups. So then this is from Perspective API which came out of Google or I guess Alphabet, but the Google parent company, and so it's a way to rate comments for whether they're toxic or not, it was released in 2017 with partnerships with the New York Times, Wikipedia, The Guardian, it's a lot of high profile partnerships, and Librarian Jessamyn West discovered that the sentence I'm a gay black woman was rated as 87% toxic in comparison to I'm a man being seen as 20% toxic. Additionally there was a lot of bias around abilities and so making statements I'm a woman who is deaf was 77% toxic, so kind of a lot of concerning bias in how things were being rated as well as just inaccuracy like these statements are not toxic. And Perspective has been working to address these, but again this is something that was released and already in use when these things were discovered. This is a more recent article and this is evaluating a tool that MIT Media Lab was developing to rate tweets about whether they were rude or not, and it was discovered that kind of African American vernacular was much more likely to get rated as rude even when it wasn't and when people were expressing positive sentiment and some of this is kind of differences in kind of the way people talk, not being captured in the algorithm and so kind of having this higher error rate and rating people's language is rude when it wasn't. So another example of this is a black woman and so this is I believe from 2017 who wrote a blog post on her own blog about being called the N-word and Google AdSense told her she was violating their terms of service for writing this. So this is kind of an issue of understanding context and I think in terms of filtering toxic or abusive content, context matters hugely and is something that is very tough to do and we see a lot of errors from the major platforms in this. And these errors disproportionately impact certain groups. So this has happened just in the last month. YouTube updated its policies regarding hate speech and in the process of doing so it removed a lot of historical and educational videos so it actually took down videos showing kind of speeches of Hitler's speeches. So these are historical, kind of a historical material which is Nazi propaganda kind of by definition of Hitler's speeches but then it's also really important historical information to have and kind of as a document of the Nazis in kind of World War II Germany. So one person who was impacted was Ford Fisher and he's not covered, so this is a Washington Post article and this is kind of like a separate blurb on the same topic. But his video footage has been used in Emmy and Oscar winning documentaries and so he had a few of his videos taken down altogether and he was demonetized. One of the videos that was deleted showed protesters confronting a Holocaust denier, another had been used in a PBS documentary. So there's this kind of issue of context of how do you, because it is important to document historical and current events and kind of separating that out from material that is kind of active hate speech or propaganda. So I wanted to highlight that as I think that's kind of a big NLP challenge and something to be aware of. And so this is kind of the same mechanism as on the slide in this woman kind of being told she's violating the terms of service and that it can make it hard to kind of talk about kind of even the educational or not educational but countering and documenting the historical impact of hate speech and of people's experiences. So that's a little bit on some of the NLP, I guess areas where bias can show up and things to be aware of. And I want to say that I think these are all hard problems to address but are very important to be cognizant of. So returning to this concept I mentioned earlier that the Harini Suresh paper highlighted. Oh yes. And actually can I pass you the. Yeah so this and I don't know I guess oh actually let me turn that up. So the question was clarifying with YouTube what is the NLP aspect that I don't know exactly how YouTube is doing this but I would assume it's analyzing the speech of videos and using some sort of speech recognition on content to identify what it's taking down. Kind of what to take down what to demonetize etc. and that that is. Yeah like I think speech would be the biggest indicator it's possible actually I'm sure that they must be using like some metadata and computer vision as well. But I think that speech would be kind of like one of the key the key inputs there. Any other questions about about this example or the other ones. Are certain best practices being formed for like data set auditing because like it seems like a lot of or one of the reasons why you're seeing a lot of these issues with you don't know if you're not paying attention to distribution of your test. Yes yes. And I guess some are some categories might be obvious but a lot of them as you said could be linked. So that's people working on figuring out how to just characterizing a train distribution data set really well. Yes that's a great question and repeating for the microphone it's what work is being done on kind of auditing training data sets and auditing the distribution and training data sets of what's included and what's not. And that actually I'll get to later in the solution section. But the kind of short answer for now is that that is an area of research but we're also kind of I think in the very early stages of adoption around it. You're right that that is I think an important component that many different groups of researchers are starting to point to as like this is a basic building block we need to kind of even just have the information of what's in these training data sets and how are they created. Any other questions. All right yeah so going back to this you know this concept of bias data is often too generic to be useful because it gets used very broadly and it's an important concept. But if you want to go beyond just identifying this as a problem we need more of a framework around this. And so I highlighted this paper which I found really helpful. Harini also wrote a blog post version of it which is great and this is in general I have a plug for I want more researchers to write blog post versions of their academic papers because I think you can reach kind of a broader and different audience by doing that. So yeah they identify that different sources of bias have different causes. Harini writes data models and systems are not unchanging numbers on a screen. They're the result of a complex process that starts with years of historical context and involves a series of choices and norms from data measurement to model evaluation to human interpretation. And so I think data can seem very black and white but there's a lot of context and choice that goes into it into how data data sets are created and how they're used and how models are trained. So in the paper they identify five sources of bias. So I believe they're working on an updated version with even more that offers a little bit more granularity. But I wanted to walk through these. So we already saw a few of these in the earlier case studies. So there's representation bias where the your training data was not reflective of the data that the model is going to be used on in production or in the real world. And then when this is kind of happening for benchmark data sets and impacting kind of entire fields and lots of companies they call that evaluation bias. And so we saw that many of our benchmark data sets that have been widely studied are biased including a lot of the facial recognition data sets and ImageNet having this strong Western bias. So then there's a paper I like by Sandeel Malanathan and Zahid Obermeyer where they look at historical electronic health record data with the goal of discovering which factors are most predictive of stroke. And so this is something they say could be useful for figuring out how to kind of prioritize people waiting at the ER of who needs to be seen. And so they're looking at a large number of factors from this historic health record data and they find the number one most predictive factor of stroke is having had a prior stroke which makes sense. The second most predictive is cardiovascular disease which also seems reasonable. The third most predictive factor of having a stroke is accidental injury. Next is having a benign breast lump. Having had a colonoscopy and sinusitis. So these factors three through six I see a lot of puzzled faces. Yeah they don't make any sense right. Like why would these things be predictive of having a stroke. And this was looking out of kind of comprehensive health record data. And so what's going on here. This really does not seem good at all. And so what the researchers identified is we haven't actually measured stroke right. Stroke is you know brain cells being deprived of oxygen because they're not receiving new blood. Really what's been measured here is who had symptoms went to a doctor received test received a diagnosis of stroke that was entered into a medical health record. So this is you know and on the surface that might sound similar like OK is this a pretty good approximation of stroke. But really what's going on is there are people that utilize health care more than others. And this is for a variety of factors of who even has access who has health insurance who can afford their copay who can afford to take time off of work. There are a lot of biases in the medical system of how how women are treated how people of color are treated by doctors. And so really what they're what their model has just found is there are people that go to the doctor when they're having a problem and people that don't. And that's ended up kind of being what was measured. And so if you're likely to go to the doctor for an accidental injury accidental injury or for sinusitis then you're also likely to go when you have a stroke. And so that's that's what got measured. And this is an example of measurement bias which is I think pretty pervasive to some extent like typically what you truly care about is not something that is or in some cases can even possibly be measured. And so you have to use these proxies. And so in health care you know you're what ends up getting used is kind of these diagnosis codes or billing codes which are actually pretty far removed from the actual you know the biological processes going on in any illness. And so this is a risk and measurement bias can take more there can take a few different forms. They give another example in the paper of sorry in the Harini Suresh paper switching back of say you had if you were measuring mistakes for a company that owns many factories if the way the mistakes are measured is different at different factories your data is not going to be as useful as you want if they're kind of you're taking inconsistent measurements. So this measurement bias can show up in a lot of different ways. And this is a case where getting more of the same data is typically not going to help you. So here you know the results are weird but even if they had increased the sample size it probably would have still been the same if they had this underlying mechanism of kind of who's utilizing health care versus who who is not. Any questions about this. There's also aggregation bias is another type. And so the example that is given in the Suresh paper is that diabetes patients have different complications across different ethnicities and one of the kind of blood indicators used to diagnose and monitor diabetes differs in complex ways across ethnicity and gender. And so kind of trying to model everyone with the same model would probably lead to errors. And this you can also have and probably often do have many of these types of biases at once. So this could be for instance combined with representation bias. So if one group is so super kind of overrepresented when you're building your model you might effectively just end up building a model for that one group and not realizing it doesn't apply to different ethnicities or different genders depending on kind of who who you were using data from. So this is this is aggregation bias and I talked earlier about historical bias which is a fundamental structural issue at the first step of the data generation process and can exist even given perfect sampling and perfect feature selection. And I think historical bias is pretty pervasive and also particularly hard to address. And so earlier I gave the example from the compass recidivism algorithm. This is also what was going on with the ads suggesting that people with black names had been arrested and with Amazon's kind of internal resume screening tool that penalized the word women's. So I want to talk to talk a little bit more about how and where historical bias can show up. And so the studies I'm going to share here are all from kind of peer reviewed research that's been done. These ones are linked in a Cindy L. Melanath in New York Times article. But this is just kind of like a small sample of the research that's out there on this topic. When doctors were shown identical files they were much less likely to recommend a helpful procedure to black patients than to white patients even when kind of the medical history was identical and they were presenting the same complaints. When bargaining for a used car black people were offered initial prices $700 higher and received far smaller concessions. And again this is in peer reviewed research kind of looking at it as a statistical sample. Responding to apartment rental ads on Craigslist with a black name elicited fewer responses than with a white name. White state legislators in both parties were less likely to respond to constituents with black names. And an all white jury was 16 points more likely to convict a black defendant than a white one. But when a jury had one black member the conviction rates were the same. And so this kind of variety to me indicates that you know we've got examples of medical data sales data. That's a combination of sales and housing data political data and criminal justice data all having this racial bias. And so it's kind of no matter where you're drawing your data from or what domain you're working in I think there's a likelihood that you're going to you're going to have racial bias in your data. To talk a few just a few stories about gender bias and these I all cite in a blog post I wrote several years ago called If You Think Women in Tech is Just a Pipeline Problem You Haven't Been Paying Attention. Investors preferred ideas pitched by a man than an identical pitch from a woman. Male narrated pitches were rated as more persuasive logical and fact based than the same pitches narrated by a female voice. So that's kind of reading identical scripts getting a very different response. Job applications with male names are rated as more competent and hireable and offered a higher starting salary compared to identical applications with female names when rated by science faculty at six major universities. When men and women negotiated a job offer by reading identical scripts women were rated as being more difficult to work with because they had negotiated whereas the men did not see this penalty for negotiating. In performance reviews of high performers in tech negative personality criticism such as abrasive stride into a rational showed up in 85 percent of the reviews for women and just two percent of reviews for men. So kind of a lot of again a lot of different areas where bias can show up in data that is you know about funding or performance or salary kind of other areas. And so all this raises the question of why does algorithmic bias matter. So I've just showed that humans are really biased too right. And this is you know one of the ways that bias ends up in our algorithms is that our kind of our human data is biased. But this often yeah leads people to kind of ask this question humans are biased. So why kind of why are people making a big deal about algorithmic bias. In fact Pedro Domingos who's a machine learning professor at the University of Washington asked this question last year and he was sharing an HBR article that looks at a few studies in which algorithms were less biased on particular tasks than a human decision maker. And so I wrote a response to that because I think that article missed a number of things about implementing computer algorithms which I'll talk about in a moment. But I want to I want to answer this this question about why why algorithmic bias does matter and why as data scientist it will be your responsibility to to be on the lookout for it and to address it. And I have four reasons for this that I'll go through. And the first is that algorithms and humans are used differently. And so we saw earlier when talking about this IBM Watson dashboard used for predictive policing that a city official said you know machine learning is always 99 percent accurate and that's false but it's a common misconception and people are more likely to to judge the outputs of a computer as being objective and being correct which can be dangerous. And so algorithms often end up being used differently than human decision makers. And so it's a it's a mistake to talk about kind of human decision makers and algorithmic decision makers as just plug and play interchangeable because in practice they're often implemented very differently. And the way this shows up is you know people are more likely to assume algorithms are objective or error free. So even if you have implemented an algorithmic system that's just kind of giving a recommendation or a guideline to a human judge humans might I mean humans typically will take it as more authoritative and also you have to look at the system of you know if you have a kind of human that's always overriding the system are they going to be you know is their boss going to give them a hard time will they be audited for not listening to the system. So even having a human in the loop can not necessarily be a safeguard. Then algorithms are more likely to be implemented with no appeals process in place. And so this is something that really concerns me and we've had kind of several really disturbing stories in the U.S. of for instance there was software implemented by the state of Arkansas to determine people's health care benefits and it turned out there was an error in the software implementation. But there were people that lost so like for instance people with cerebral palsy who needed a home health aid to help them with kind of a task of getting out of bed getting their breakfast who lost like 20 hours of care a week that they really needed due to this. The software error and there was no appeals process and no easy way to kind of ask why this decision had been made and the error was only discovered through a lengthy court case and it's something that could have never come to light. You know it's kind of like even a matter of luck that it was surfaced. Another story that's kind of scary is there is software used in I believe Virginia or DC to fire teachers and there was no way to appeal the mistake and so there was a teacher who she had great reviews from her principal and the parents of her students. This is an elementary school teacher really liked her and she got fired by this algorithm and there was kind of no way to appeal it or even get an explanation. Algorithms are often used at scale so when they are biased they can be kind of replicating the like an identical bias at scale whereas even though humans are biased and with very common patterns to our bias there's at least some kind of individual differentiation and then algorithmic systems are cheap and I think these are all very related like I think the reason algorithmic systems are in many cases being implemented is not because of their accuracy or better performance but as a cost cutting measure and again I think being on the lookout for mistakes or giving people a way to appeal mistakes typically cost more and so I think that's often why it's not included which is not a good justification of it but I think there's a lot of interplay of these factors of kind of trying to cut cost, to do something cheaply and at scale and it can be very disastrous when there are mistakes. Any questions about this? And so this is kind of at the core of why I don't think you can look at humans and computers as being just interchangeable in a very kind of plug and play way. The second reason that algorithmic bias concerns me is that and why it matters is that machine learning can amplify bias and so this is a point I covered earlier sharing the research studies bias and bios and reducing gender bias amplification under corpus like constraints that it's not always just a case of encoding existing biases but it can be making them worse. The third reason why algorithmic bias matters is that machine learning can create feedback loops and runaway feedback loops and so this can occur in predictive policing where kind of if the algorithm predicts that there's going to be more crime in a certain neighborhood it'll send more police to that neighborhood which then itself can become a cause in there being more arrest in that neighborhood which can then feed back into the algorithm to be like let's send even more police there and this has been written about in kind of computer science papers but basically feedback loops occur when your model is controlling the next round of data you get and so I think it can be easy in tech to kind of sometimes underestimate our impact on the world and think like oh we're just kind of observing existing data or analyzing existing data but if that's used in a product at all or in decision making it's really impacting what your next round of data is. Suresh Venkateswaramanian who's a researcher in this area and one of the authors on this paper said predictive policing is aptly named it is predicting future policing not future crime since this is an area where it's really creating the next round of data that the system gets. We also see this a lot with YouTube. YouTube's recommendation system so I read the updated stat today people watch five billion hours of YouTube per day. That's just this huge number. YouTube has over one point eight billion active users a month. So YouTube is very very widely used platform and it has done a lot to promote conspiracy theories and actually I guess I'll talk about this more next week when we talk about disinformation but kind of the mechanism with YouTube is you know so on the one hand it's it's trying to predict what people will like but it's also determining what people see because 70 percent of time spent on the platform comes from its up next which is its recommendation system when you're watching kind of you know on the right side gives you this list of recommendations and then it begins auto playing the next one. So that's again that 70 percent of the time spent on the platform is these videos selected by YouTube auto playing for people and they disproportionately include conspiracy theories that promote white supremacy anti-vaxxing climate change denial a number of harmful of harmful things. And then the fourth reason that algorithmic bias matters is that technology is power and with that comes responsibility so of the global population 56 percent of people have internet access so there are there are many people that don't have internet access. Seven percent have a college degree and less than one percent know how to code and so I think that particularly for all of us just even being able to be in San Francisco knowing how to code being data scientist that's a huge amount of power that's an opportunity very very few people in the world have and with that there's kind of a responsibility to use it well. And I think of sometimes conversations around you know human bias versus algorithmic bias degrade a bit into kind of you know what's the least terrible existing option we have is you know is one thing marginally better than something else. I'd really like to see more focus on how can we develop less bias ways to make decisions perhaps using some combination of humans and algorithms but build build systems that will lead to better outcomes for people. Yeah and so those are those are kind of the reasons that that algorithmic bias matters and then I guess this is kind of a perfect time for a break. We'll return at twelve ten and then I'll start talking about some steps towards solutions. Okay so let's start back up. So I'll talk about kind of some steps towards solutions with bias. This isn't a problem that we can easily solve or completely solve and then after that we'll start on the transformer architecture. So I'm kind of thinking about what something concrete that you can do in response to this and that would be to I think analyze a project at work kind of as you're starting new jobs in the next few months or there's only a week and a half left but if you do have any projects at school that you want to analyze and the first or kind of step zero to that is asking is asking whether it's something that should be built or created at all. And so I have to credit off keys for this point they shared this is a paper kind of on design when the implication is not to design but engineers and data scientists myself included often tend to respond to problems with you know what can I make or build to solve this problem but sometimes the answer is to not make or build anything. An example that Oz shared on Twitter was research I believe from 2017 facial feature discovery for ethnicity recognition including of the Uighurs which is a Muslim minority in western China and a million people have been put in internment camps from this minority and so this is kind of showing prior to this research was done on how to recognize them with facial recognition and so this is a kind of really disturbing application of computer vision. There's also you know there's been research on trying to tell someone's sexuality from their pictures and there's a lot of issues with even the quality of this research but that's something I don't think we should be doing in terms of a poses safety concerns in many places you know the idea that you could you could tell someone's sexuality from their picture it's also a violation of privacy and kind of self-determination. So really kind of thinking about these questions of you know what are the things that we shouldn't build and that could that could be weaponized and used to harm people. And so kind of on this topic so IBM sold technology to Nazi Germany Swiss judge ruled that this probably did help them to be more efficient during the Holocaust and this was you know recording kind of whether whether people were Jewish recording if they were gay and this is you know this is not a question of like how could IBM have like used a different data set or structured the technology different it's more of a they shouldn't have been selling technology to help the Nazis and so this is I think very kind of sobering but important to realize and also to realize that genocide doesn't happen overnight and I actually don't know what year the IBM began working with the Nazis but you know it begins with often kind of registering and tracking people from from marginalized groups and then can proceed to internment camps which can proceed to concentration camps. Here's an article the role of data collection and genocides that covers several different examples this is a card of and Rwanda how people's ethnicities were kind of tracked and registered prior to the Rwandan genocide. They also talk about the internment of Japanese Americans in the United States during World War II which used US census data. So this is something to get to really be mindful of I guess I left this in last year 2018 the UN ruled that Facebook had played a determining role in the genocide in Myanmar and this is something that people close to the matter said is not 20 20 hindsight. People were warning Facebook in 2013 2014 2015 about how the platform was being used to incite ethnic violence which again is kind of an example of genocide not happening overnight. You know initially the warnings are this is being used to incite violence that kind of gradually escalates. I mean I think it's important to think about these examples but also to realize there's a range of technologies that should not be built that are not as extreme as contributing to genocide but something to really really consider kind of how how your work could be weaponized in ways that you don't you don't intend. And so I added this is kind of put together some questions to ask about AI and I put this together a few years ago and just recently added this should we even be building this is kind of the first question to consider. And kind of so kind of beyond that if you determine that the project you're working on is not not something that you think could be used to cause a lot more harm than than potential benefit. Moving beyond that it's good to ask what biases in your data. Can the code and data be audited. What are air routes for different subgroup subgroups. What is the accuracy of a simple rule based alternative. So I mentioned this when we were talking about the recidivism algorithm used in the criminal justice system that researchers from Dartmouth found that you know here there's this there's this one hundred thirty seven input black box model that's doing no better than a linear classifier on three variables. It's really important to have a baseline to even know what is what is high accuracy. And then asking what processes are in place to handle appeals or mistakes and kind of knowing that any mistakes will happen with with computer software. I mean we're human we make we make mistakes with everything and really thinking about how can you monitor to try to catch mistakes as quickly as possible and have a response to minimize harm and address them quickly because I think kind of some of the scariest stories are when there's there's no way to even notice or surface mistakes. Yes. I wonder if we talk about this in context of GPT 2. Yeah open AI. Yeah. Yes. The question is about open AI decision not to release GPT 2. Let me save that for next time because I was going to talk about GPT 2 next time in the disinformation lesson. But that's a good question. And just kind of briefly it's around this question of they're doing a they're calling it a staged release but recognizing they were alarmed about some of the risk of their research and so choosing not to release everything that would be needed to replicate it right away. And I think that's also a very kind of like newer discussion to be having within computer science particularly of you know there tends to be a real culture of openness and kind of balancing that with the risk. So that's a great question. I'll come back to that next time. And then also asking kind of how diverse is the team that that built technology or you know particular particular product that you're working with. So kind of continuing with this that analyzing a project at work or school there are many many different frameworks you can use to do that. Here's an example. A company was someone was trying to sell them an algorithm to screen resumes and they asked for an audit before they would purchase it and they learned that the two factors most indicative of job performance according to this tool were being named Jared and having played high school lacrosse which is really terrible and so terrible it's almost funny but it's bad. It's great that the company asked for this audit though. So this is kind of like in some ways a success story that they insisted like hey we want to know how this works and discovered like oh this is terrible this is not something we should use because it's definitely better to discover that before before you start using the product. And so next I'm going to talk about NLP data statements and this is getting back to the earlier question of kind of like how do you how can we audit our data and this is a paper that came out pretty recently from Emily Bender and Batia Friedman and it's also worth looking at Batia Friedman wrote I think one of the original papers on data and algorithmic bias in the 90s kind of classifying three different types of bias that's that's worth looking up and so part of part of these data statements is recognizing that all data has bias biases in it you're not going to get perfectly kind of bias free data and so we just need to be aware of what those biases are also no system is immune to emergent biases because you can kind of get this interaction of what biases arise when you're using a system and so the goal is to provide context so developers and users can understand how results might generalize what the appropriate uses of particular software is and what biases might be reflected in systems built on the software. So they give an example of so basically the idea is kind of when you create a data set or using a data set to really just record a lot of the choices that went into creating it as and I really loved Nikhil had a great slide on this of kind of all the questions of like who curated this group of this corpus of books that was used like what choices were made in that who was left out of it and so that Emily Bender paper recommends yeah what was the rationale behind the curation who made those decisions what was the variety of languages and Emily has spoken up a lot about you know not often the kind of I guess particularly the American NLP community will often kind of assume English is the default or just not even say what language they're working with when they're working with English but really specifying what language you're using and also what variant because even within English there's a huge amount of variation depending on who you're talking with and about the demographics of the speakers the demographics of the annotators so if you're using labeled data the people that did the labeling that's significant and it's going to impact what those labels are and potential biases in them the time and place of speech characteristics of the text quality of the recording for for audio as well as other information and so this is a kind of a lot of potential things that can play into it and they have kind of more specific recommendations about this is for the long form but also having like a shorter form that's a single paragraph that could be more easily shared but this will be useful for anyone kind of using that data set in the future or using research that was done on that data set and so there's been a number of kind of groups working on similar ideas they all have different variations I chose to highlight the NLP statement since this is an NLP course there's this idea of nutrition facts for data and so kind of a way to kind of show some key key factors about about data there is Timnit Gebru et al wrote data sheets for data sets which is that was one of my favorite papers last year and Timnit's coming from electrical engineering background and kind of modeled it off of the data sheets that come with electrical components like circuits or resistors and this is more this was kind of a little bit more generic than the NLP statements and that it was geared towards kind of any data set and machine learning but that was that was a great paper a group from Element AI in Montreal came out with this idea of data licenses which I think is really interesting but kind of in creating a data set saying who can use it and how it can be used and what the appropriate uses are because you know some data sets may be appropriate to use in one context but not another and just getting kind of some of that more context out there and so this is I think a really interesting proposal even though it has Montreal in the name it's not just for Montreal but kind of wanting this idea of to have you know standard licenses around data sets is interesting and in the Bender and Friedman paper they talk about the fact that you know similar groups are kind of proposing or sorry different groups are proposing these similar ideas around giving more context about how data sets were created and how they should be used as kind of a confirmation that this is an idea that the field is converging to it's still in its early stages and that you know while many of these papers propose potential formats it's not something that we've developed you know definite standards around they have still you know kind of in the early stages of adoption but this is something I think really to kind of keep an eye on and to start including in your own work. Any questions about this concept of kind of how to audit your data set? Something else that's nice is both data sheets for data sets and NLP statements give examples to in the paper of kind of sample data sets and what would a data sheet or an NLP statement for that data set look like. Something else you can do in kind of auditing a project that you're working on or in your workplace is to check the accuracy on different subgroups so we've seen this gender shades example a few times throughout the talk now and here I just want to highlight how important it is that Joy looked at dark women specifically as a subgroup if she had just been looking at men versus women kind of light-skinned women would have brought up the accuracy for women and then if she had looked at dark skin versus light skin or sorry yeah dark skin versus light skin dark skinned men would have brought up the accuracy for the dark skinned group and you wouldn't have seen kind of how truly terrible this is on dark skinned women and so kind of having that intersectional looking at each subgroup on its own is important. And it's just yeah I know it's wild that this can happen in commercial products that were released. Proactively recognizing risk and addressing them so this is a positive story from Meetup. When Meetup was implementing a recommendation system recommending what meetups people might be interested in and this is from a talk Evan Estola the lead machine learning engineer at Meetup gave he kind of the team recognized the fact that fewer women were interested in technical meetups and so there was a risk that the recommendation system would learn not to recommend technical meetups to women. However going back to this concept of feedback loops you know their Meetup isn't just predicting what people will like it's also informing people of what exists and so this could cause fewer women to even find out about technical meetups that they might be interested in which the system would then learn to recommend even fewer technical meetups to women and so they kind of chose to try to short circuit that in their design of the algorithm. So that's a great example of kind of proactively recognizing a risk and coming up with a solution. So that's kind of yeah some guidelines towards just even how you could analyze a project at work or school. Second step towards doing better and reducing bias is to work with domain experts and those impacted by the products we're building. And so I gave the example earlier of Christian Lum a statistician from the Human Rights Data Analysis Group doing this by partnering with a former public defender as well as an innocent man who could not afford bail and had been and who was labeled as high risk by this algorithm to really share a lot of kind of this knowledge about how these systems work in practice and what human systems they're interacting with. Third thing to do is to increase diversity in your workplace. I really encourage people to start at the opposite end of the pipeline the workplace so there's often a lot of talk about you know getting more little girls into coding. Over 40 percent of women working in tech end up leaving the field compared to just 17 percent of men until and then kind of until this attrition rate is addressed getting more women into the field is not going to fix the gender or address the gender imbalance as long as those women kind of leave. Meta analysis that looked at hundreds of books articles and studies on this topic concluded that women are leaving the tech industry because they're treated unfairly underpaid less likely to be fast-tracked than their male colleagues and unable to advance. And this kind of too often diversity initiatives end up just focusing on white women which is wrong women of color facing even additional obstacles. There was a study that interviewed 60 women of color working in stem research and 100 percent of them had experienced discrimination. The particular kind of stereotypes and types of discrimination they experienced varied by race. Only half of black and Latino graduates with computer science degrees from top universities are hired by major tech companies and so this is kind of another reason why looking at kind of how how companies are currently operating is very important and that they're kind of overlooking a lot of qualified applicants. And then there was research from MIT showing that organizations that promote meritocracy actually show greater bias in favor of men over equally performing women. So a lot of a lot of research on this topic of kind of why why we need to address the workplace and kind of improve improve the environment in the workplace. I've linked a lot of this research into blog posts that I wrote. If you think women in tech is just a pipeline problem you haven't been paying attention and the real reason women quit tech and how to address it and each of these links to kind of dozens of studies on the topic and offers some concrete steps. And then here are some headlines of kind of about black and Latino graduates being overlooked and the yeah believing in meritocracy kind of has the opposite effect. And one step back from kind of improving the work environment is looking at the hiring process and I know I know I'm sure you some of you I know are still interviewing and are kind of feel like might feel far away that you're going to be on the other side of the table but can it happen very quickly like I've been in jobs where really like in my first or second month they have you interviewing people. So it's good to kind of already already be aware of this. Research shows diverse teams perform better. I've written a post on how to make tech interviews a little less awful. There's a lot that's broken about the interview process in tech and it's painful for everybody no matter who you are but often in ways that can kind of disproportionately impact people from underrepresented groups. You don't have to be a manager to make a change. Julia Evans who's a software engineer at Stripe wrote a great blog post about how even as an individual contributor she was able to kind of come up with a rubric just initially to improve her own consistency in interviewing and it ended up being adopted by the whole company. So I thought that was pretty inspiring and a tip on kind of how we can start start improving the interview process. Any questions on on this. Yeah so file this away for later because it'll I think you'll hit it sooner sooner than you might expect. Then the next step is advocating for good policy. I think that we're facing a number of problems that won't be solved by technology alone and you know someone coming with this math and computer science background I definitely relate to and experience the impulse that I kind of when I hear about a problem I want to use the things I'm good at to try to address it. That many of the problems I think we're seeing right now are going to need a combination of tech and policy to address. In particular I mentioned earlier kind of the human rights and civil rights that that need to be safeguarded. And then I think this regulation it can be easy to focus on regulation that is stupid or doesn't work and to take for granted the things that are working well. Something I really liked about data sheets for data sets is that they cover three case studies of how regulation and standardization came to different industries. They look at the electronics industry the pharmaceutical industry and car safety. And I ended up getting really interested in car safety and kind of read or listen to some more about it. But a few things I hadn't known is that early cars there were sharp metal knobs on the dashboard that could lodge in people's skulls in crashes. Collapsible steering columns would frequently impale drivers and then even after the collapsible steering column was invented it wasn't implemented right away because there wasn't a financial incentive for the car companies to implement it. But it's something now where collapsible steering columns have saved more lives than anything other than seat belts. So seat belts is number one and collapsible steering columns number two. And then there was also just kind of this belief that cars were just kind of this neutral piece of technology and the issue is how people use them. And so it took consumer safety advocates and activists decades to kind of shift the national conversation on this. The car companies were very resistant to people even talking about car safety. They did not want data data even being collected on car safety because they didn't want people thinking about crashes. And so that was kind of a major win by consumer safety advocates even to get the data collected. And now the culture has very much shifted in terms of car companies brag about their safety and sell that as a feature. But that's an idea they were very resistant to. And so this was this was interesting to learn about. Another fact I didn't know is that in crashes of a similar impact women are 40 percent more likely to be injured than men. And it was only in 2011 that they updated the laws about crash test dummies that they should also represent the average woman anatomy and not just men. Prior to that crash test dummies were kind of based on men's bodies. And so that's kind of what was being used to you know for the safety standard. And so I think this is kind of like an interesting case study of kind of how these cultural and technical considerations kind of mesh and combine. And then as I as I shared earlier many ethics concerns are about human rights. And I've heard I've heard some people say that just even the language of ethics can imply kind of that this is something more philosophical or voluntary even though in many cases we're talking about human and civil rights. And then the final the final piece is that just even if you do kind of these first four things it's never it's never like you can finish kind of checking you know on your checklist checking everything off and being like I'm done I don't have to think about bias because it's you know can continue to emerge in new ways.
