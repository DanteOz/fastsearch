{"text": " We are back with face coverings in public now mandated across most of the Bay Area, six counties. You probably have lingering questions so we know just the person to answer those questions and also to show us two more ways to easily make a mask using stuff you have at home. University of San Francisco data scientists and founder of mask for all Jeremy Howard joins us once again. Hey Jeremy good to see you. Hello there, nice to see you too. I know I can't wait to get to the mask making because I just think that's so useful for many people but first I would like to clarify for our viewers under what situations they need to wear a mask now when they're out and about in the Bay Area. Let's talk about when they're absolutely required. Yeah so they're absolutely required both legally and practically they're nicely aligned which makes it easy. Basically whenever you're out and about except when you're exercising not when you're at home and not when you're in the car with family members or on your own in those situations there is no requirement under the orders to wear a mask. Okay in fact that is you just answered Jonathan Rose Ahmad's question. He asked do I need to wear a mask if I'm just going to take a walk around the neighborhood. Social distancing has been fine aligned this along the sidewalk so you just said it's not necessary and of course it's not legally required but should you? I mean could it be extra beneficial given what happens when you're exercising? You know I mean it depends how cautious you want to be. I haven't been able to find any documented cases in the scientific literature of transmission occurring in that situation. Transmission outside in general is about 20 times less common than transmission indoors and the transmission that does tend to occur outside tends to be at things like sports events, Mardi Gras, sing-alongs, lots of people getting together and making a lot of noise. But you know again if you want to be careful you may as well particularly if you're if it's not like if it's not windy if you're sitting close to somebody outside for a while those kinds of situations you may as well be careful. Personally when I'm jogging I try to make sure I'm not jogging right behind somebody so I'm not kind of in their slipstream and of course I try to make sure that there's a six feet distance whenever I'm passing by so I try to kind of wave and find a way to navigate with people so that we all stay out of each other's way. That's right. You know I do want to ask you because I see a new survey by True Public out today that shows 29% of Americans refuse to wear a mask when they leave the home but that doesn't mean two-thirds are now either doing it all the time or open to the idea. Do you consider actually that's a pretty big shift in attitude? Yeah I mean it's amazing I mean I'm Australian born I'm now you know based in San Francisco. Honestly I never thought this would happen in my lifetime. I never used to wear a mask I never cared about masks until I studied the science around this and if you had asked me would people in America be wearing masks like more than half or more than half talking about it I'd be like no way that's gonna happen but turns out when our lives are on the line we can change our behavior. Absolutely and I think there's still some confusion over the purpose of a mask right? Is it that when we wear one we're protecting ourselves or are we protecting others? Well you've set up a nice segue here Kristen so the basic the basic mask is largely about protecting other people. Here's the thing when you're breathing in a mask it actually creates a little humid atmosphere in that tiny space in front of your mouth and the droplets that come out of your mouth stay big enough to be captured by the cloth mask so that works really well so that means that if you're infected and don't know it and remember half of infections come from people that are infected and don't know it you can protect other people from your possibly infectious droplets by wearing a mask. It helps protect you a bit as well but not as much because once you know if I if somebody around you doesn't have a mask on and they're breathing or talking the droplets come out and they evaporate and after they evaporate they become so small that to catch them requires some special tricks which I can show you if you're interested. Right which we can do ourselves with those special tricks because you want to leave the N95s that filter them out for the medical professionals and right they are most exposed on the front lines. I want to fold in a question from a viewer Lily and Padua Marquez she's asking how about shared rides like Lyft or Uber do we need to wear a mask as well when we're taking those? Both legally and practically so you know those workers that are giving you that ride they're super at risk right and you're sitting there in an enclosed space with them they're seeing lots of people every day please keep them protected by wearing a mask and that is required under the you know the Bay Area requirements. Okay and Randy wants to know are masks required to be worn by customers in a California State building? Now this is interesting right because there are some California State buildings that are not in the counties here that are requiring them so the state doesn't have a ban. I mean right you know right Governor Newsom's kind of dropped the ball at this point a lot of states are requiring masks and both Republican and Democratic governors are getting behind this important safety issue for whatever reason Governor Newsom is not being as progressive as we usually see on these kinds of issues where we're not following the science yet and I really hope to see that change. Okay so basically if you're in a state building that's not in one of the cities covered by county order then you actually don't have to although you would say you should. As far as I know there's nothing special protecting state buildings outside of areas like the Bay Area and Santa Cruz and other places that are doing it themselves despite the governor's inaction. What about the continued thought that look if you don't wear it right if you don't wear it correctly if you're a futzing with it all the time or you put it down on a surface that's contaminated it's actually potentially more harmful for you. Yeah I mean a lot of people are saying that but my reaction is like come on think about it right like if there's virus particles in your mask but if two things has happened either you're infected in which case too late right or somebody infected around you the mask has stopped the droplets they're now on your mask and not in your mouth. This is a respiratory disease you get sick if it goes into your mouth into your nose or into your eyes not onto the top of your mask or even on your hands right I mean be a bit careful take it off from the side put it in some soapy water but at this point I've studied so many scientific papers I haven't yet found a single example of transmission through cloth so it's pretty speculative issue anyway it's certainly not more risky than the virus going into your face which is literally how people get sick. Okay well you've got me convinced Jeremy so what we're gonna do in the next segment after a short break is we're gonna mind the gap you know the gap that when you make your own face covering so we're gonna figure out how to cover that and it's not that hard. I call this leveling up your mask we're gonna level up our mask. Okay sounds good we'll take a short break on the air but of course you can continue the conversation with us over on our live streams and we'll be back with mask making with Jeremy Howard. Alright so folks Jeremy and I are gonna show you how to make two types of masks so what I want you to do and Jeremy you can pipe in is get some sort of if you have a mask or a covering that a homemade one or even like a cloth go grab it and if you have foil right go grab it tin foil something like that a wire or a coffee filter foil or but just aluminium foil is fine. Okay and then get three rubber bands I've already tied my three together. Biggish ones not too small. Not too small okay right well I had that problem earlier I didn't think my face was that big but the rubber bands didn't fit so I had to grab a bigger a center one and then Jeremy you also recommend getting a pair of glasses right because of the eyes you want to protect the eyes. Yeah sunglasses are fine. Okay so folks if you also have time and if you have paper towels grab a paper towel because that's another method in a pinch and then a couple more rubber bands and if you're doing that one staples please. Staples staples which Jeremy doesn't have. Exactly they're quick they're easy and there's certainly a lot you know better than no protection also if you live in one of the six counties in the Bay Area that now recover not recover sorry require face coverings then you'll want to have one handy. Now Jeremy I wonder if you're seeing stores yet locally that are just handing you a mask as you go in are you seeing that in this country because I've seen that in some other countries. Not in this country a lot of countries do yeah you know there's some great video online showing how Austria is doing this in every store there's somebody at the front handing out masks to everybody coming in yeah I haven't seen it yet around here I don't know if any of the folks watching have that'd be so cool yeah that would be like such a great customer safety focus for us to do that. All right let us know on Facebook if you've seen a store or a facility that's just handing out masks as you enter all right we're coming back on him. And we are back with University of San Francisco researcher data scientist and mask for all founder Jeremy Howard all right Jeremy we promised folks that we're gonna just take a few quick minutes and show people how to make a face covering more effective mind the gap if you will so let's go ahead and get to work. I love it mind the gap I wish I'd invented that I'm stealing it it's great okay feel free all right should we create the gap first with a gappy one yep so this is my mother-in-law mask she's a genius and she's created this lovely mask which in the default setting we're gonna have the gap you want to see the gap yes yes let me see it I will try and do this without destroying my home studio I see I see I believe my nose is flatter and therefore the gap is smaller but yes I still have one yes I mean it's true you know the the nose is something I have it's a sign of a you know a great gentleman I hear it truly is okay so what do we do about it alum aluminum I will try and use the American aluminum foil I literally just cut it out and fold it up okay and you can use a coffee filter you see how nice and moldable yeah this so my genius mother-in-law has put this little slip in here for me now if you don't have a genius mother-in-law I don't I mean you can just use genius but she didn't sew one for me yeah careful yeah just pop it in here or else just use tape I'm taking it on to whatever you're using it doesn't matter and the thing is this is actually what surgical masks have in I think they might use something at more advanced than yeah oil okay that does the same thing because now what I do after I pop this on is I've just push pop right yep under my distinguished nose and now yeah me too less of a gap it's not perfect but it's a lot better yeah yeah okay I get it so that's better protection that you have that seal okay so you want to level up another level I do okay so an Apple engineer X Apple engineer invented this here are three rubber bands that I've literally just you know hooked into each other yep and what I do is I put the middle one around my fingers and put it over mine over the top this is really important over the top sorry under the top of your mask and then you can either do it under your depending on how big it is under your chin or under your mouth okay and then behind one ear and swap hands behind the other ear and then what I do is I kind of like push the fabric in so that it's like squishes what does that do it just means it doesn't fall out so much you know I otherwise I'd kind of have to stick my lip out or get Botox or something well there's nowhere to get it right now so don't do that yeah have a look at this okay oh yeah I see now you have kind of formed a tight seal around the mouth area in the nose area so there's actually very few spots for the air to come in now and so doctors do a breath test at this point to kind of feel that when you breathe out you know are you feeling air coming out and this is actually you know it's nowhere 95 and what you know one key thing actually is the the if somebody around me has been you know rude enough to not wear a mask they can infect me because these droplet nuclei that evaporate out spread in the air I have stopped them from coming in a lot to the holes but they could come straight through the fabric right so what I do to stop that is the genius mother-in-law I mentioned thank you Linda has created a nice pocket for me here to put this wonderful nanomaterial which under an electron microscope looks very very much almost the same as the inner layer of surgical masks and it's called a paper towel and actually somebody at the National Academy of Sciences with a laser chamber helped me with this and he found that the you know the nice thick kind of bounty paper towels just one of them does a 99% good job of stopping the droplets when they come out and they should do a pretty good job of stopping the nuclei and they come in as well fantastic okay so I wanted to ask you if we have one minute left to show me the other method which is what the paper towel so as I mentioned I'm too poor to have stapler here so I've just sticky taped it okay this is just a piece of that magic paper towel yep that I've got you know just staple a rubber band onto each end okay and then get the piece of foil out of course now that I'm on TV it's not going to come out for me yeah I get the piece of foil out here it comes and pop it you know the nice thing about these pieces of paper towel nowadays is that they have the fold in the middle yep so we can just take the foil pop it in the middle like so okay and then pop it mold it okay and then over each ear and then the only other thing I would say for both of these cases all right hey Jeremy we got to finish this up on our live stream because we're out of time on here. Please put glasses on as well because they can come through your eyes. So the website is maskforall.co right yeah but the number four the number four okay thank you go check us out on the live stream okay all right Jeremy we're still on Facebook so we got a few minutes a couple minutes so I didn't do the wire for there I still need to either tape that or just put it in the middle right between the yeah just chuck it in the middle that works for me yeah it doesn't really fall down because at least my nose gets in the way sufficiently all right so a lot of people are asking could you use you know coffee filter yeah what else works you know name all the things that you could use those are the two I'm aware of you know a lot of people say microfiber cloth I haven't studied it but it sounds sensible to me you know anything with a nice tight weave but you know anybody can get paper towel I hope yeah no do you have any idea do we have any studies as to what percentage of people are complying in the places that do have these mask orders yeah we do it's it's increasing rapidly obviously it varies by jurisdiction but there are places in the u.s. that are up to 70 80 percent now and that's even some of those even without laws in place so people are doing a great job of protecting their communities I think it shows a lot of care yeah I mean I always think it's kind of strange when it becomes sort of a political statement because health and politics should be completely separate but that does seem to be the case if you look at what happened on the House floor today as House members were debating the relief bill it seemed that you know most of the Democratic members had their masks on and they will pull it down to speak and many of the Republicans were not wearing them so well that there are Republican senators like Senator to me and governors like Larry Hogan that are coming out strong pro-mask so it's not entirely partisan yeah I'm hoping that it's not partisan right your health when it comes to health it's everybody's and the economy yeah absolutely all right great information great tricks and tips thank you so much always fun to try Jeremy yes all right bye bye", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.72, "text": " We are back with face coverings in public now mandated across most of the", "tokens": [492, 366, 646, 365, 1851, 2060, 1109, 294, 1908, 586, 47563, 2108, 881, 295, 264], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.14666481018066407, "compression_ratio": 1.606060606060606, "no_speech_prob": 0.196306973695755}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 4.72, "end": 9.96, "text": " Bay Area, six counties.
