{"text": " All right, so the next kind of big case study or topic I want to discuss is disinformation. So in 2016 in Houston, a group called Heart of Texas posted about a protest outside an Islamic center. They told people to come armed. Another Facebook group posted about a counter protest to show up supporting freedom of religion and inclusivity. And so there were kind of a lot of people present at this, more people on the side supporting freedom of religion. And a reporter though for the Houston Chronicle noticed something odd, which he was not able to get in touch with the organizers for either side. And it came out many months later that both sides had been organized by Russian trolls. And so this is something where you had the people protesting were, you know, genuine Americans kind of protesting their beliefs, but they were doing it in this way that had been kind of completely framed very disgenuously by Russian operatives. And so when thinking about disinformation, it is not, people often think about so-called fake news, you know, and inspecting like a single post, is this, you know, is this true or false? But really disinformation is often about orchestrated campaigns of manipulation and that it involves, can involve seeds of truth, kind of the best propaganda always involves kernels of truth, at least. It also involves a kind of misleading context and can involve very kind of sincere people that get swept up in it. A report came out this fall, an investigation from Stanford's Internet Observatory where Renee DeResta and Alex Stamos work of Russia's kind of most recent disinformation or most recently identified disinformation campaign. And it was operating in six different countries in Africa. It often purported to be local news sources. It was multi-platform. They were encouraging people to join their WhatsApp and Telegram groups. And they were hiring local people as reporters. And a lot of the content was not necessarily disinformation. It was stuff on culture and sports and local weather. I mean, there was a lot of kind of very pro-Russia coverage. But that it covered a range of topics. And so this is kind of a very sophisticated phase of disinformation. And in many cases, it was hiring locals kind of as reporters to work for these sites. And I should say, well, I've just given two examples of Russia. Russia certainly does not have a monopoly on disinformation. There are plenty of people involved in producing it. Kind of on a topical issue, there's been a lot of disinformation around coronavirus and COVID-19. In terms of kind of a personal level, if you're looking for advice on spotting disinformation or to share with loved ones about this, Mike Caulfield is a great person to follow. And he's even, so he tweets at Holden. And then he has started an infodemic blog specifically about COVID-19. But he talks about his approach and how people have been trained in schools for 12 years. Here's a text. Read it. Use your critical thinking skills to figure out what you think about it. But professional fact checkers do the opposite. They get to a page and they immediately get off of it and look for kind of higher quality sources to see if they can find confirmation. Caulfield also really promotes the idea of a lot of critical thinking techniques that have been taught take a long time. And we're not going to spend 30 minutes evaluating each tweet that we see in our Twitter stream. It's better to give people an approach that they can do in 30 seconds. You know it's not going to be fail proof if you're just doing something for 30 seconds. But it's better to check than to have something that takes 30 minutes that you're just not going to do at all. So I wanted to kind of put this out there as a resource. And he has a whole kind of set of lessons at lessons.checkplease.cc. And he's a professor. And I in the data ethics course I'm teaching right now I made my first lesson the first half of which is kind of specifically about coronavirus disinformation. I've made that available on YouTube. I've already shared it. And so I'll add a link on the forums. If you want a lot more detail on disinformation than just kind of this short bit here. But so going back to kind of like what is disinformation it's important to think of it as an ecosystem. Again it's not just a single poster, a single news story that has you know is misleading or has false elements in it. But it's really this broader ecosystem. Claire Wardle of First Draft News who is a leading expert on this and does a lot around kind of training journalists and how journalists can report responsibly talks about the trumpet of amplification. And this is where rumors or memes or things can start on 4chan and 8chan and then move to closed messaging groups such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger from there to conspiracy communities on Reddit or YouTube then to kind of more mainstream social media and then picked up by the professional media and politicians. And so this can make it very hard to address that it is this kind of multi-platform. In many cases campaigns may be utilizing kind of the differing rules or loopholes between the different platforms. And I think we certainly are seeing more and more examples where it doesn't have to go through all these steps but can jump forward. And online discussion is very, very significant because people it helps us form our opinions and this is tough because I think most of us think of ourselves as pretty independent minded but discussion really does you know we evolved as kind of social beings and to be influenced by people in our in-group and in opposition to people in our out-group. And so online discussion impacts us. People discuss all sorts of things online. There's a Reddit discussion about whether the US should cut defense spending. You have comments, you're wrong. The defense budget is a good example of how badly the US spends money on the military. Someone else says, yeah, but that's already happening. There's a huge increase in the military budget. The Pentagon budget is already increasing. I didn't mean to sound like stop paying for the military. I'm not saying that we cannot pay the bills but I think it would make sense to cut defense spending. Does anyone want to guess what subreddit this is from? Oh. Unpopular opinion, news, change my view, net neutrality. Okay. Those are good guesses but they're wrong. I love the way you say that. This is all from, well, it's from the subsimulator GPT-2. So these comments are all written by GPT-2. And this is in good fun. It was clearly labeled on the subreddit that it's coming. And GPT-2 is a language model from OpenAI that was kind of in a trajectory of research that many, many groups were on. And so it was released I guess about a year ago. And should I read the unicorn story, Jeremy? Okay. So many of you have probably seen this. So here, and this was cherry picked but this is still very, very impressive. So a human written prompt was given to the language model. In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote previously unexplored valley in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorn spoke perfect English. And then the next part is all generated by the language model. So this is a deep learning model that produced this and the computer model generated. Dr. Jorge Perez had what appeared to be a natural fountain surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow. Perez and the others then ventured further into the valley. By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue with some crystals on tops at Perez. Perez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them. They were so close they could touch their horns. While examining these bizarre creatures, the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Perez stated, we can see for example that they have a common language, something like a dialect or dialectic. And so I think this is really compelling prose to have been generated by a computer in this form. So we've also seen advances in computers generating pictures, specifically GANs. So Katie Jones was listed on LinkedIn as a Russia and Eurasia fellow. She was connected to several people from mainstream Washington think tanks. And the Associated Press discovered that she is not a real person. This photo was generated by a GAN. And so this I think gets kind of scary when we start thinking about how compelling the text that's being generated is and combining that with pictures. These photos are all from thispersondoesnotexist.com, generated by GANs. And there's a very, very real and eminent risk that online discussion will be swamped with fake manipulative agents to an even greater extent than it already has and that this can be used to influence public opinion. So actually I guess, well, I'll keep going. Going back in time to 2017, the FCC was considering repealing net neutrality. And so they opened up for comments to see how do Americans feel about net neutrality. And this is a sample of many of the comments that were opposed to net neutrality. They wanted to repeal it and included, I'll just read a few clips. Americans as opposed to Washington bureaucrats deserve to enjoy the services they desire. Individual citizens as opposed to Washington bureaucrats should be able to select whichever services they desire. People like me as opposed to so-called experts should be free to buy whatever products they choose. And these have been helpfully color coded. So you can kind of see a pattern that this was a bit of a mad libs where you had a few choices for green for the first noun and then in orange or red, I guess it's as opposed to or rather than orange, we've got either Washington bureaucrats, so-called experts, the FCC and so on. And this analysis was done by Jeff Kao, who's now a computational journalist at ProPublica doing great work. And he did this analysis discovering this campaign in which these comments were designed to look unique but had been created kind of through some mail merge style, kind of putting together a mad libs. So this was great work by Jeff. He found that while they received, the FCC received over 22 million comments, less than 4% of them were truly unique. And this is not all malicious activity. There are many kind of ways where you get a template to contact your legislator about something. But in the example kind of shown previously, these were designed to look like they were unique when they weren't. And more than 99% of the truly unique comments wanted to keep net neutrality. However, that was not the case if you looked at the full 22 million comments. However, this was in 2017, which may not sound that long ago, but in the field of natural language processing, we've had like an entire kind of revolution since then, there's just been so much progress made. And this would be, I think, virtually impossible to catch today. You know, if someone was using a sophisticated language model to generate comments. So Jess asks a question, which I'm going to treat it as a two part question, even if it's not necessarily. What happens when there's so much AI trolling that most of what gets straight from the web is AI generated text? And then the second part, and then what happens when you use that to generate more AI generated text? Yeah, so for the first part, yeah, this is a real risk, or not risk, but kind of challenge we're facing of real humans can get drowned out when so much text is going to be AI trolling. And we're already seeing, and I, in the interest of time, I can talk about disinformation for hours and I had to cut a lot of stuff out. But many people have talked about how kind of the new form of censorship is about drowning people out. And so it's not necessarily kind of forbidding someone from saying something, but just totally just drowning them out with a massive quantity of text and information and comments. And AI can really facilitate that. And so I do not have a good solution to that. In terms of AI learning from AI text, I mean, I think you're going to get systems that are potentially kind of less and less relevant to humans and may have harmful effects if they're kind of being used to create software that is interacting with or impacting humans. So that's a concern. I mean, one of the things I find fascinating about this is we could get to a point where 99.99% of tweets and fast AI forum posts, whatever, are auto generated, particularly on kind of more like political type places where a lot of it's pretty low content, pretty basic. And the thing is, like, if it was actually good, it wouldn't even know. So what if I told you that 75% of the people you're talking to on the forum right now are actually bots? How can you tell which ones they are? How would you prove whether I'm right or wrong? Yeah, I think this is a real issue on Twitter of particularly people you don't know of wondering, is this an actual person or a bot, I think is a common question people wonder about and can be hard to tell. But I think it has significance for, has a lot of significance for kind of how human government works. You know, I think there's something about humans being in society and having norms and rules and mechanisms that this can really undermine and make difficult. And so when GP2 came out, Jeremy Howard, co-founder of Fast AI, was quoted in the Verge article on it. I've been trying to warn people about this for a while. We have the technology to totally fill Twitter, email, and the web up with reasonable sounding context appropriate prose which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter. So one kind of step towards addressing this is the need for digital signatures. Oren Etziani, the head of the Allen Institute on AI, wrote about this in HBR. He wrote, recent developments in AI point to an age where forgery of documents, pictures, audio recordings, videos, and online identities will occur with unprecedented ease. AI is poised to make high fidelity forgery inexpensive and automated, leading to potentially disastrous consequences for democracy, security, and society, and proposes kind of digital signatures as a means for authentication. And I will say here, kind of one of the additional risks of kind of all this forgery and fakes is that it also undermines people speaking the truth. And Zeynep Tefekci, who does a lot of research on protests around the world and in different social movements, has said that she's often approached by kind of whistleblowers and dissidents who in many cases will risk their lives to try to publicize like a wrongdoing or human rights violation, only to have kind of bad actors say, oh, that picture was photoshopped, that was faked, and that it's kind of now this big issue for whistleblowers and dissidents of how can they verify what they are saying and that kind of that need for verification. And then someone you should definitely be following on this topic is Renee DiResta. And she wrote a great article with Mike Godwin last year framing that we really need to think disinformation as a cybersecurity problem. You know, it's these kind of coordinated campaigns of manipulation and bad actors. And there's, I think, some important work happening at Stanford as well on this. All right.
