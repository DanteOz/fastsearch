{"text": " Cool, me too. And then who in here has some sort of anxiety or any negative feelings about math? Okay, so yeah, a few people, not as many as I often hear, but I wanted to explain this because I get this a lot from people who really don't feel good about their own math ability or kind of have anxiety around it. So there's a beautiful essay called A Mathematician's Lament by Paul Lockhart. And Paul Lockhart was a math professor at Brown, and he quit to go teach KQ12 education because he thought math education was such a disaster in the United States. And so he has this essay where he writes about a world where children are not allowed to sing songs or play instruments until graduate school, because it's really important that they have over a decade of studying music notation and transcribing notes by hand before we can let them sing. And so it sounds horrifying, like that doesn't make sense to make people wait till they're 20 to sing. But that's what we do with math education is what he argues. And I agree that we often focus on kind of a dry, disconnected notation and that the really more beautiful and creative parts of it don't come until later after many people have dropped out of the field. This is an essay called The Myth of Innate Ability in Tech by Omuju Miller. And Omuju has her PhD in CS education from Berkeley. And this, I think this myth shows up a lot in mathematics as well. But it's the idea of like, oh, and this idea is completely false and the evidence is against it. But the idea that, oh, some people innately have a brain for math and some people don't, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I think it's particularly prevalent in the United States, this idea that some people can, yeah, their brain works that way, other people's don't. And that's not the case. But it's a very harmful myth. Then it gets worse if you're a woman in that there was a study, so 90% of elementary school teachers are women in the United States. And I apologize. What I'm saying is very US-centric and that's what I'm kind of most familiar with the research for. But this is something that really varies a lot from culture to culture. And you will see like there's some countries where, you know, there are a ton of girls on the math Olympiad teams at all levels. But yes, it's an area where the US is not strong. But so most elementary school teachers are women. And in college, the major with the highest level of math anxiety is elementary education. And then this often gets transmitted to kids kind of subconsciously. And there's a study that found, and this was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is very prestigious kind of top journal, that girl children pick up on that anxiety. And it impacts how they see the gender ability around math, whereas boys students don't pick up on it from women teachers. So it's kind of harmful to girls, but not to boys. And so this is something that may be impacting people or definitely is impacting people. And then another issue is in the US, there are a lot of stereotypes and myths about the ability of people of color. And so particularly if you're black or Latina or indigenous, you may have encountered kind of negative stereotypes or perceptions about your math ability. And I just wanted to share all these with kind of just all the forces that might be kind of conspiring against you, loving math as you could, and that have nothing to do with your actual ability or aptitude. So there's this guy on Twitter that said to do machine learning, you have to love math as a teenager, which I think is false. And so I responded, many kids are turned off to math because of poor teaching methods, lack of resources, lack of support. Doesn't mean you can't learn machine learning later. And then all these people responded with really inspiring stories. And so I just wanted to share a few of them. So one is data science Renee, who is a data scientist, has a large Twitter following and a data science podcast. She says that she struggled with certain teachers and with ADHD and that she didn't start. She didn't take advanced math until she was over 30 years old and she became a data scientist at 34. Stephanie said that she didn't love math until age 36 when she returned to school for a biology degree. And now she's becoming a data scientist. And then my favorite was Kimberly said I'm learning machine learning as a 50 year old with straight A's and a PhD program in biomedical informatics and health data science. Age is just a number. So I thought that was really inspiring. And just yeah, for any of you that do feel a little anxious about math, I hope this is inspiring. Oh, and then one more. This came out just a week or two ago at Cathy O'Neill. Weapons of math destruction is very good. Yeah, I'll mention it a few times. If you're interested in bias and algorithms, Cathy has a book called Weapons of Math Destruction. She also blogs at mathbay.org. And she has her PhD in math from Harvard. But she wrote this article in Bloomberg that a mathematician's secret were not all geniuses. And she says you don't have to be a genius to become a mathematician. If you find the statement at all surprising, you're an example of what's wrong with the way our society identifies, encourages and rewards talent. So I definitely agree with that. And then she also says to even imagine becoming a mathematician, I had to ignore the question of whether I was a genius or whether I would need to be a genius. Had I been poked and prodded and measured to see how exceptional I was, I probably would have lost the nerve. Yeah, so just some more confirmation. And I just wanted to kind of put all that out there before I get into it.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.0, "text": " Cool, me too.
